Haglin',E'1899-1900',E'Important experiment in grain storage that ended up being an important rudiment in the development of modernism--as all concrete grain elevators trace their roots back to this one. Previously, grain elevators were mostly constructed out of wood (risking fire or explosion) or metal (also risking explosion); desiring a new form of large, fireproof design, grain merchant Frank Peavey hired local civil engineer Charles F. Haglin and they opted to use relatively modern material of reinforced concrete. Haglin built a section of round formwork braced with steel hoops. Concrete was poured in and given time to harden, at which point the framework was removed and reassembled above to produce the next section. As the world\'s first known cylindrical concrete grain elevator, its success led to use on a much larger scale in the port of Duluth, and influence throughout the major shipping hubs (with such elevators becoming landmarks throughout the Midwest). Before he founded the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius collected images of the grander examples of grain elevators in Buffalo, NY, impressed by their use of reinforced concrete forms--these took advantage of scientific advances (reinforced concrete) to create functional structures, devoid of ornament, yet monumental analogs to the "works of ancient Egyptians." Photos of these were part of Gropius\' first-ever public lecture in 1911, "Monumentale Kunst und Industriebau Lichtbildervortrag" [Monumental art and industrial construction slide show, with 69-slides], given at the Museum Folkwang in Hagen, Germany, where he introduced the "new monumental style" into European architectural discourse. A selection of these images were printed as a photos in the 1913 yearbook of the Deutscher Werkbund (Jahrbuch des Deutschen Werkbundes), which led to their wide dissemination. They were repeatedly published and interpreted thereafter, influencing Erich Mendelsohn (who later made a pilgrimage to Buffalo to see them himself), Bruno Taut, Antonio Sant\'Elia, and most famously Le Corbusier, who artistically altered and republished them in his seminal 1923 book "Vers une Architecture" (Toward an Architecture) as "the first fruits of the New Age." The connections between this particular pioneering grain elevator and European modernism has been written about by such books as Reyner Banham\'s "A Concrete Atlantis" (1986). It is sometimes referred to as "Peavey\'s Folly," based on unfounded concerns the public had with its viability as untested technology: there were fears the structure would explode during its test. During the initial experiment in 1899-1900, it was built up to 68ft (interior diameter 20 ft) with walls tapering from 12" at the base to 8" at the top; grain was stored from fall to spring to see how it would fare. When it worked, they built it up to 125ft for more experiments, then it was never used again. It became a sign for adjacent businesses, most notably locally based Nordic Ware, which spent $40,000 in 1969 on restoration (it has been a sign for the company\'s adjacent plant since). Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, proclaimed a National Historic Landmark in 1981, and a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1983.'),

Before he founded the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius collected images of the grander examples of grain elevators the Western hemisphere, impressed at how they took advantage of scientific advances (reinforced concrete) to create functional structures, devoid of ornament, yet monumental analogs to the "works of ancient Egyptians." Among his photos was an early photo of this very grain elevator. The photos of these were part of Gropius\' first-ever public lecture in 1911, "Monumentale Kunst und Industriebau Lichtbildervortrag" [Monumental art and industrial construction slide show, with 69-slides], given at the Museum Folkwang in Hagen, Germany, where he introduced the "new monumental style" into European architectural discourse. A selection of these images were then printed as a photos in the 1913 yearbook of the Deutscher Werkbund (Jahrbuch des Deutschen Werkbundes), which led to their wide dissemination. Once again, the Washburn "A" Mill #1 Grain Elevator made the cut. These images were repeatedly published and interpreted thereafter, influencing early European modernists such as Erich Mendelsohn (who later made a pilgrimage to Buffalo to see some himself), Bruno Taut, Antonio Sant\'Elia, and most famously Le Corbusier, who artistically altered and republished them in his seminal 1923 book "Vers une Architecture" (Toward an Architecture) as "the first fruits of the New Age." The grain elevator became a landmark for the large, neon sign above it advertising "GOLD MEDAL FLOUR" added in 1910 (Gropius\' photo was taken before the addition); originally lit with 1,500 tungsten globes placed in the recessed portions of the letters, but the bulbs were replaced by neon during a 1945 restoration. The mill complex itself was considered the most technologically advanced and largest mill in the world at the time; it led to the development of food giant General Mills. Simultaneously listed on the National Register of Historic Places and proclaimed a National Historic Landmark in 1983. After it closed, a fire in 1991 nearly destroyed the neighboring mill itself (the elevators were not damaged); museum (Mill City Museum) was built within the ruins (2001-03) with an award winning-design by Meyer, Scherer & Rockcastle, with the grain elevators preserved and restored by MacDonald & Mack.

Hausler and Associate Harry Firminger, that gave it an Art Deco façade and detailing. The driving factor for the change was street-widening by the City of St. Paul: in the 1920s they opted to widen University Ave as a primary link to Minneapolis, and this resulted in the demolition of the northernmost 20-feet of the creamery. The milk company opted to remain at the location and use it as an opportunity to design a modern, reinforced concrete structure sheathed in polished granite and smooth limestone; the exterior has stonework, bay patterns, and defined window openings (that were, for many years infilled with concrete block or mid-20th century insulated glass windows); as noted in the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: the lower part of the façade is polished black Cold Spring granite, "sheathed above in smooth light limestone, and crowned at the parapet with a recessed zigzag and diamond cut-stone band. Projecting from the parapet on both elevations are a series of mid-late 20th century industrial light fixtures that were designed to make the limestone surfaces glow in flooded light." Above the main entry was low bas-relief of a giant milk bottle flanked by two children (Mistress Polly Plump and Master Henry Husky). The Minnesota Milk Co. was sold in 1956, the new owner later bought Minneapolis-based Old Home Creameries and subsequently consolidated operations to Minnesota Milk but the name to Old Home Foods. Old Homes Foods moved out in 2009 and, thinking the building was going to be demolished, removed the bas-relief of the children and milk bottle, as of 2019 it was not returned... Listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 5, 2014. In 2014-15 the building was converted into 60 income-restricted apartments (Western U Plaza); the $16.9M project included additions where non-notable warehouse and shed additions had been), and in the process the building (and removed windows) were restored sympathetically.

By substituting a structural steel frame which conformed with the concrete plans, the architects obtained a substantial reduction in cost." The building is constructed of reinforced concrete and the exterior walls are faced with light-colored brick. The roof of the arena is arched and supported by hinged steel trusses, providing a clear floor area; the eastern section of the building has a flat roof. The main entrance vestibule has a tall curved ceiling following the shape of the roof (originally ornamental plaster painted in iridescent green with shadow molds in silver); AR noted "By an ingenious use of sandblasted sheets of crystal and colored glass on the inner pane of the large windows, the transmitted light varies in color and intensity during the day." In addition to the prominent arena, it was designed with space a bowling alley, curling rinks (taking up the main portion of the flat-roofed section), 400-seat theater ("Little Theater"), and space for the American Legion & Ladies\' Auxiliary, Boy Scouts, lounges, billiard and card rooms, and administrative offices. Per AR, "The plan was evolved from suggestions received in answer to a questionnaire sent to civic organizations and the residents of the town." Size was based on the 15,000 residents of Hibbing as well as the addition 75,000 who lived in the surrounding Iron Range communities.

Luyten House (1939) and Skywater (1941). Flat roof, two stories, horizontal redwood siding. The client was a Professor of Astronomy, who wanted functional designs that would fit their lifestyle; the architects employed a detailed intake for assembling a program, something then-rare for single-family homes. Prof. Luyten was highly involved in the design process and even crafted a cardboard model to understand the arrangement of rooms, and conducted calculations for sun exposure and solar gain from windows. There was a lot of study in planning, as windows all had to be certain sies and placements to please the clients—becoming an elevation problem. The windows were all custom made as the architects were determined to use casement and awning windows (common in Europe) rather than the double-hung windows that were popular in the United States but had an additional horizontal sash, obstructing views. The interior was designed using gumwood, plaster, brick, and an industrial engineered wood that offered sturdiness but was rarely used in homes (architects had recently employed it in the Ray Fauklner House). Prof. Willem Jacob Luyten (1899-1994) was born and grew up in the Dutch East Indies and later moved to Holland by his teen years, where he studied astronomy and earned his PhD at age 22; by 1931 he moved to Minnesota where he taught at the University of Minnesota from 1931-67, then served as astronomer emeritus from 1967 until his death. His work was substantial, and Luyten\'s Star, star system Luyten 726-8, and Asteroid 1964 Luyten are among the celestial objects named after him. Owned/renovated by Richard C. Lundin, II (AIA) as home and office. Featured in Jane King Hession\'s "Elizabeth Scheu Close. A Life in Modern Architecture" (2020).'),

Featured in the June 1936 issue of Architectural Record (AR). Each classroom of the $33,000 building had more than twice the glass area ordinarily used in regular classrooms or required by state regulations; AR described the east and west walls as "practically all glass, continuing around the corners about 8 feet or a little more than 1/3 the width of the room"; as it used glass block, the structure was just as notable for having no openable windows "as the air conditioning is designed to provide fresh air to each room throughout the day at a rate of 30 cubic feet per minute per pupil." Further, AR noted "The glass-brick walls average a 65% vacuum which serves as an insulator to heat, cold, and sound, but they do not carry any structural loads." The original lighting was controlled by a "photo-electric relay or eye" which controlled the amount of illumination based on the amount of sunlight. Built on the southeast corner of a municipally-owner park, setting aside 3 acres to allow for a large playground at the rear. As far as pedogeological approach, the classrooms were arranged in informal groups and not in the conventional fixed straight lines. The school closed in 1962 when it became a vocational school, and closed for those purposes in 1967. Currently used for union apprenticeship and training.

Hennepin County bought the armory in 1989 for $4.7M to replace it with a new county jail; in July 1989, a Hennepin County court removed the local historic landmark designation from the Armory. The Minnesota Historical Society sued to save the building and, in January 1993, the Minnesota Supreme Court overturned a district court decision and ruled that the Armory was protected under the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act and could not be razed because of its historical status. Hennepin County Board agreed to sell the Armory in 1998 to a private developer for $2.6M under the requirements that the new owner must restore and preserve the historic structure and allow the county to maintain the Veterans Memorial Garden; the developer, in turn, spent $2.9M to convert the building to a parking structure.

Stone taken from the local quarry and finished at the Rockville Mill. The construction used two stones that were originally from the Library of Congress in Washington, DC: they had been sent to the Rockville plant for repair but were discarded; the gray granit was from an eastern quarry and were used to add a decorative note to the front entrance; unlike the local pink granite, they were finished with ornamental carving. The original structure comprised 4 classrooms, teachers\' room, combination gymnasium-auditorium, furnace room and coal bin. The design was made to be flexible for future additions.

As noted by historian Andrew Schmidt, "The primary façade has a symmetrical tri-part arrangement, with a recessed entrance bay flanked by projecting pavilions. The center bay is paneled in smooth limestone with Classical- and Art Deco-inspired motifs. On the north and south elevations, vertically stacked window openings with patterned dark brick spandrels alternate with the orange-brick walls. This pattern simulates solids and voids, implying a stylized colonnaded façade. The first-floor lobby and the auditorium are significant interior spaces, with Art Deco motifs, including zigzag-and-sunburst, vertical fluting, and stylized floral patterns. The walls flanking the stage are a particularly exuberant example of these motifs." In addition to a gymnasium, it also previously held police department (with office and jail cells), municipal court (with courtroom and judge\'s chambers), and city offices. A previous combined auditorium and municipal building from 1910 burned in February 7, 1933. Firm hired in 1933, submitted 3 design options; the City Council selected the option with the largest auditorium. The new building was dedicated on February 26, 1934 and cost just over $75,000. Builder: Bert Norby. It served as City Hall until the 1960s. The Police Department moved into a new dedicated building in 1975, other city offices moved out in 1998. In 2007, it and the adjacent arena were traded to Pennington County by the city; the county is debating razing the building, however in 2019-20 began to look into getting the structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places (application prepared in on June 24, 2019) to get state Legacy Funding for possible adaptive reuse.'),

By 1926 the Mississippi River had become dangerously polluted, and the Minnesota State Board of Health declared the river a public health nuisance. The Metropolitan Drainage Commission was formed in 1927, and after several years of study (and little action from either city council), it was replaced by the state-created joint Minneapolis-St. Paul Sanitary District (MSP Sanitary Dist) in 1933 to begin the design and construction of the Twin Cities\' first wastewater treatment plant. James A. Childs, the Metropolitan Drainage Commission\'s first chief engineer, selected Pig\'s Eye Island after considering 16 different locations and numerous plans (he died heart disease in April 1935, 3 years before plant opened). The project requested $18,000,000 in federal funds through the New Deal\'s Public Works Administration, and the full amount was granted in January 1934 (without issue; designed to be issued in 2 phases, in the end $16,000,000 was granted, nearly $300M in 2021). In July 1934, the ceremonial first shovel of dirt was moved and construction was begun on the network of large sewage lines (called "interceptors") that delivered waste from the two cities to the plant; the process took 3yrs to complete. Plant construction was begun in 1935, and the administration & laboratory building was completed in January 1937; approximately a year later, the plant was completed and dedication ceremonies were held on May 16, 1938. In addition to the Administration Building, the plant featured a large Pretreatment Building, housing the screen and grit chambers, and a Filtration & Incineration Building for processing sludge. These buildings were located at the north end of the plant where the sewage entered from the main interceptor. Past the buildings to the south were two sets of 15ft deep settling tanks, each set covering an area roughly the size of a football field, and two banks of effluent filters composed of fine-grained sand. Chlorination was used to chemically treat water. Chief Engineer of the MSP Sanitary Dist during construction was C.C. Wilbur, who was controversially ousted by the trustee board in May 1938 (at the end of construction) and succeeded by his assistant George J. Schroepfer (apparently because they could pay the 32yr-old Schroepfer less). When it opened in 1938, it was the first plant in a metropolitan area on the Mississippi River, and grew to become one of the country\'s largest. Hailed as an engineering marvel before it opened, the plant was hailed as a "savior" of the river. Within 4 months the floating mats of stinking sludge and scum were gone, within 2 years, fish returned to metro waters. Due to its low elevation, it suffered floods in 1952, 1965, and 1969. With the capacity of the plant far in excess of the cities\' needs, the joint district had sold services to the suburbs until capacity was reached in the early-1960s. This sewage issue became the progenitor of what became the Metropolitan Council, a regional governmental agency and metropolitan planning organization as it expanded to include transportation (Metro Transit), land use, regional planning, water quality, etc. Only one of the three original buildings remained (the other two were demolished c.2008 and c.2015 respectively). Referred to in bid requests (1937) as "Administration Building, Sewage Treatment Plant, Pig\'s Eye Island," later renamed the Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro Plant). Plant has grown to over 100 acres in size and is part of a network of 11 such plants, all under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Waste Control Commission (MWWC), established by the Minnesota Legislature in 1969. it remains the largest wastewater treatment facility serving the Twin Cities'),

The original structure employed cutting-edge use of reinforced-concrete skeleton frame construction, allowing for the façade to be an ornamental curtain wall rather than load-bearing: this design was a major factor in allowing a radical remodel. At the time the original building was completed, it was claimed to be "the world\'s largest reinforced concrete office building."

Designed to support future expansion, in 1927 Long & Thorshov were commissioned to design a 25-story tower addition (unbuilt) that would\'ve risen from the building\'s central light well. Garage levels added in 1929 (architect: Larson & McLaren, Builder: Pike & Cook). The reinforced-concrete skeleton frame permitted the exterior to be complete redone in what was then said to be "the largest alteration project ever attempted in the city" when Thorpe Bros. opted for a $100,000 redesign by Larson & McLaren that gave the structure a modern, streamlined appearance. After the renovation it was featured in a September 1937 ad (in Architectural Record) for its use of mortar-sealing products by The Master Builders Co. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 5, 2014, based primarily on the cutting-edge use of reinforced concrete construction.

O Larson); the home was designed to cost $3200 or less and be affordable for someone on an income of $125-per-month. The hope was such low-cost construction would help stimulate post-Great Depression construction. The two-story house used wood-frame construction, as many local materials as possible. The original lay-out was living room, kitchen, dining on the 1st floor; 2 bedrooms and bath on the second floor; laundry and rec room in basement. Larson noted "The design is based on the need for convenience and beauty in the smallest possible space. Waste space has been entirely eliminated. Windows at the corner of the rooms provide a maximum of furniture space and perfect cross ventilation. The use of a flat room reduces heat loss one-third. Double insulation will make a specially designed heating system operate at a fraction of the usual cost." There was a bigger social hope for these kinds of low-cost houses, as economists at the time worried about a rise in rent costs (16% across 1934-35); Larson noted "Experts are agreed that a resumption of construction activity must come before unemployment can be substantially reduced. In all our building booms, no homes have been constructed for the family of small income. Yet social workers are agreed that better housing for the masses will benefit the whole community while reducing crime, police and fire protection, disease, accidents and other social ills." Originally built in a sharp Moderne style, with strong horizontal lines and a lovely vertical decorative flourish above the main door. At some point in its history, the house had its Moderne charm stripped from it and replaced a bland gable roof. The original exterior had soul, the kind that comes from the hand of a competent designer (often, but not limited to architects); the current appearance has the look of "good enough" that comes from a builder looking to squeeze a buck.'),

The State Capitol Commission was to assure the maximum opportunities for North Dakota citizens to work on the project (especially in light of the ongoing Great Depression); however, local Hebron Brick Company was unable to meet production, so the exterior was clad in Indiana limestone. Labor strikes resulted in the construction being administered by martial law. The State Capitol Commission made architects remove much of the exterior ornament; the result ended up giving the design a look that resembled the International Style that dominated the post-WW2 era. The 18th floor of the Capitol is an observation deck with the highest vantage point in the state.

Research was first headed by Dr. C.H. Bailey, who had previously been head of the cereal chemistry department at the University of Minnesota. Per the company, the experimental work was hoped to "throw a decidedly new light on improving flour and related products. There is a great deal to be accomplished in the way of experimental research in the milling industry. In fact, no outstanding forward step has been made in the milling of cereals since the roller mill replaced the stone mill in about 1880.

An intimate study is to be made in the new laboratory of milling processes, flour treatment, flour color and bleaching processes."

The 4-story-plus-basement red-brick structure was designed with classrooms, laboratories (especially for photography), offices, reading room, auditorium for 250, and a museum; the layout was described in a contemporary report as "streamlined." The interior design emphasized adaptation to function, elimination of cross-traffic through halls, and isolation of seminar and research rooms from other sections of the building. The accent stone used is Bedford limestone from Indiana, which was delayed by a stone workers strike in that state (to the chagrin of Mankato\'s stone industry, and criticism from the editorial board of the Mankato Free Press). The newspapers described the architectural style as "a modern adaptation of the classic architectural style used in other buildings in that section of campus." The structure features Art Deco lettering of "JOURNALISM" above the door, as well as ornamentation in the use of identifying marks (borrowing the publishing term colophons) of well-known figures in the history of the graphic arts; these were designed by St. Paul sculptor A.J. Brioschi and carved over the two main entrance doorways, as well as in metal in spaces between windows. Total cost: $275,000. The structure was approved in 1938. Federal funds covered 45% of its costs via the Public Works Administration (PWA, under the New Deal). Named after former publisher of the Minneapolis Tribune, William J. Murphy (d.1918); a portion of the building costs came from his bequest, and other funds were provided by the board in control of student publications. Builder: L.P. Hagstrom Const. Co. Opened for classes in February 1940. Its May 1940 dedication was a highlight of a 3-day conference on journalism attended by major editors and professors from around the nation, the ceremony included the regional directory of the PWA out of Chicago. Murphy published the Grand Forks Plain Dealer (ND) from 1880-89, then became owner/published of the Minneapolis Tribune in 1891; he left a gift of $350,000 for establishment of a school of journalism at the university known as the "W.J. Murphy Endowment Fund for a School of Journalism," which led to the school\'s founding in 1924.

The 45% of the $2,000,000 cost was provided by a federal New Deal grant under the Public Works Administration (PWA); the rest was raised by campus organizations, gift campaigns and a loan of $400,000 which was to be paid off from operational proceeds. The building had no less than 16 pianos when it opened. Exclusive of the garage the building originally contained 3,200,000 cubic feet; Architectural Record described it as "practically a small city in itself." The structure was originally built entirely of reinforced concrete, per Architectural Record: "skeleton frame, steel pan slabs and joists, concrete beams, girders, columns and square footings. For the underground garage, which is 125 by 475 ft. in area, the flat slab type of construction was used, with two-way reinforcing, round concrete columns with drop panels and capitals, and square concrete footings. Exterior walls are made up of red-tone wire cut face brick with stone trim, backed up with load-bearing clay tile; platforms and steps are of limestone. Windows are painted steel casements. The roof is covered with built-up roofing; portions of the roofs used as terraces are surfaced with red quarry tile laid over a waterproof membrane. Roof metal, flashings, etc. are of galvanized iron; louvers are of copper." The underground garage had access from both the building as well as separate entrance structures in the plaza in front of the main building.

The house had two major phases: the initial design by Bergstedt, then after a 1965 renovation by architect Joseph Michaels, including a significant addition, which brought it into style more fitting of that decade. The original design (1939) was a modest 2-bedroom rambler with red cedar siding on the exterior; most windows faced the back of the house for privacy; the main door treatment comprised a series of overlapping frames (originally painted white) to enhance a recessed door flanked with narrow panels of glass block. The interior design, using an open design for living and dining areas, was noted for its contrast of wall areas and windows creating "a very sleep appearance to the interior" with "Lovely colors and cleverly sealed furniture to give [. . .] rooms an elegance seldom achieved in small houses" with "walls painted a soft turquoise with one wall and cabinets extending the length of one all in a bleached oak and windows curtained above in ivory Celanese [. . .] to make contrasting surfaces into a symphony of soft tones." The second bedroom featured corner windows. Bergstedt\'s design was aimed to design a "clean-cut house that wouldn\'t cost too much to let him have peace of mind after he moved in." To save on costs, he only used stock, factory-made millwork, including the large windows placed across the rear of the home. The interior walls were finished with inexpensive wood-veneered wallboard. In describing his own design, Bergstedt stated "It\'s a house devoid of expensive frills, modern, comfortable, and natural to our way of living: a good house for beginners." The original design\'s "unusually simple lines and good building proportion" alongside its adaptability to most locations helped its selection by Better Homes & Gardens house for October 1945.

The Martins had the living room designed around a a large painting "Peaceful War" by University of Minnesota art professor Freddy Muñoz (1931-2020); the original fireplace was redesigned so the large painting could be built into the space above it; Deutsch then added bands of horizontal pecan and walnut inlaid paneling flanking the fireplace.

Original light fixtures remain in the main lobby. The main stairwells feature bronze railing and travertine wainscotting on walls and under the balustrades. Travertine paneling was built around the lockers on the first floor to make them part of the building. The hallways on upper floors were wainscoted in tan-glazed tile (also wrapping around lockers). The administrative board room on the first floor was paneled in wood. The entire building was wired for a public address system, a modern addition at the time. An elevator was built to the storage room in the basement to solve transportation issues with large quantities of supplies and books needed at certain seasons of the year. In an unusual design feature for the 1930s, the classroom doors had windows (five clear glass panels) whereas most schools had windowless doors. The classrooms had built-in shelves, cupboards, and drawers for equipment; the initial layouts were partitioned and arranged to the needs of the specific teacher it was planned for during construction. The library was originally on the second floor, finished in black walnut paneling with room for 12,000 books. The restrooms on each floor were wainscoted with gray marble from Neshobe, VT, as were the washroom/shower areas of the locker rooms. The auditorium proper was wainscoted with tan-colored glazed tile to a height of 6ft.

The original wing was financed by a $1.25M bond. The design was considered "ultra-modern" (impressing the editorial board of the Minneapolis Tribune) and featured 28 regular classrooms, 11 special rooms and laboratories; a gym annex were added to east of auditorium soon after opening. A sketch of the new structure was featured prominently in a national ad for Honeywell (then Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co.) room thermostats, in the March 1950 issue of Architectural Record, boasting "Today school administrators throughout America are insuring [sic] the health and working efficiency of teachers and students by installing advanced Honeywell controls in their modern schools." Additions starting in 1960 added a classroom wing on the north (parallel with the short side of the "L") and then along the east side (described as a "wrap-around") forming a pair of courtyards described in plans as a larger "quadrangle" and smaller "court." The path to the 1960s additions included one of the ugliest, and public disputes between Minnesota architects: After the October 1, 1958 defeat of a proposed $4,650,000 school bond issue to build a new senior high school designed by Thorshov & Cerny (and convert the existing building to a junior high), firm principal Robert G. Cerny accused rival architect, Albert O. Larson (principal of Larson & McLaren and resident of Edina), of "unprofessional behavior" for writing an open letter in the local weekly (Edina Courier) ahead of the bond vote where Larson called the school "extravagant," dismissed the $17psf cost as being "gold-plated," claimed the board\'s arguments for building it made up of "untruths and half-truths," and asked "Just why should we build a new senior high school except to satisfy the vanity of the architect and create a monument to the school board." Upon hearing of Cerny\'s plans to file complaints with the state licensing board and American Institute of Architects (AIA), Larson was defiant: "It is my opinion that Mr. Cerny is looking for a $200,000 fee from a community for which he has no interest except collection of such a fee." (Cerny was then residing in Deephaven) While Larson survived the action brought against him before the state licensing board, the AIA, during its June 19-21, 1959 meeting, held that Larson violated mandatory Rules 8, 15 (8: "An Architect shall not knowingly injure falsely or maliciously, the professional reputation, prospects or practice of another Architect." 15: " An Architect shall at no time act in a manner detrimental to the best interests of the profession.") and terminated his membership in the organization. Larson then filed a $500,000 lawsuit against the AIA and Robert G. Cerny, though the disposition of the case was not publicly revealed and it\'s unclear what became of it. Larson retired in 1963 and moved to Florida. During this saga, the school board opted to simply build a phased addition to the original school building and working again with Lang and Raugland (one of 5 options drawn up by firm architect James A. Brunet). Presently used as the Edina Community Center and Normandale Elementary School.'),

He and his wife did most of the work on the house, except for the actual laying of concrete blocks, electrical wiring, and plumbing work; it was originally built around a large oak Mrs. Brower didn\'t want removed. The kitchen had clerestory windows for natural light without glare, and the stove was built-in, with electric burners in a cement slab and an oven made of fire brick. The house featured a heated concrete floor topped with slate slabs; bathroom reportedly had a glass ceiling. The house became a local landmark, allegedly causing traffic accidents as passing drivers looked at it. Featured in The Minneapolis Star (01/10/1950), which noted the passive solar design, with twelve 3\'x4\' windows on the south side of the living room generating heat. Brower designed fixed slat "Curtains" that were left in and out of the front windows to regulate the amount of sun in the living room.

Exterior comprises vertical redwood siding that was given a soft color tone with a wiped-off mixture of white lead and green pigment, with shed roof with white fascia extending a large overhang to allow for passive solar in winter. The living room windows were originally a mix of fixed and ventilating sashes. Light buff brick comprises the fireplace. At the time the house was less than 1,000sf, with a plan for future expansion to turn it into its current L-shape (completed by 1953 aerial). BHG noted the house demonstrated several things: "That a small, shed roofed house can have warmth and softness the year round. [. . .] That big windows are an asset in winter as well as summer, brining an ever-changing, picture-post-card view into the house, with no physical discomfort. That site selection of your new house is of greatest importance in the \'off\' season, when you can\'t count on the camouflage of a man-made view. Proper orientation can give you the economy of extra heat from the sun. Here, the lot faces due west. But the house is swung toward the southwest, so the living-room wall of glass catches maximum solar heat in winter." The living room was originally only 13ft-wide, but the large windows made it spacious. A very large, projected hearth created extra seating space while also reflecting warmth from winter sun; the BHG article featured a great photo of June "charcoal-broiling steaks on a three-legged copper unit, a favorite activity on extra-special wintery evenings for the family alone and when they are entertaining. The big raised hearth serves many purposes; it could be a counter for a buffet serving of a friendly crowd." A large studio-bedroom also included a fireplace. Designed as a one-level home. Design credited to Harlan McClure. Morris (1918-79) was an associate professor of art at the University of Minnesota, and served as co-chair of the Fine Arts Department from 1947-52; a noted painter and member of the New York school of abstractionist artists as well an art historian. His first major solo exhibition was at the Walker Art Center in 1952, and his art was also in the Albright Gallery, Whitney Museum of American Art, Guggenheim Museum, and in the collections of major corporations; he had also taught at Cooper Union, University of Texas, and Stephens College (MO), and been a visiting critic at Yale; he died of an aneurysm, age 61, while living in NYC. June Christopherson Morris was a designer and weaver of textiles. House also known as the Robert Raymer House. Siding later painted blue. '),

Architect\'s own house: Graffunder did almost every aspect of the house himself: he spend a month in summer 1948 finding the right lot, designed the house that winter (discarding two entire plans in the process), then in June 1949 broke ground on the hillside; the only work he did not do (save for a helper) was plastering and wiring; by May 1950, the house was ready for move-in, with some add\'l work being completed; the total cost (land, house, furniture) was $10,500; Graffunder felt "A house is just an excuse for living in a certain place--it\'s just a shelter" thus designed his living room with a wall of glass looking out towards Theodore Wirth Park (at a spot he and his wife specifically chose); the house is a hillside-walkout split across 3-level, the bottom level has 2 bedrooms plus utility area and tool shop; the middle level (with red tile for hard wear) has the dining room, kitchen, laundry and main entrance; the top floor is a 20\'x28\' living room with large windows taking in the view; the upper two levels are open to each other but for a fireplace with depressed hearth; Graffunder saved money by using standard-size building materials without cutting, a type of concrete block which gives complete insulated wall with no other material needed, cypress siding left to weather to silver gray; a rafter effect was achieved by pairs of 1"x6" cedar boards for tie beams; the interior paneling was inexpensive gum plywood, waxed; the house used radiant heating with copper coils in the basement floor and living room ceiling; the panel of 6 experts, who toured the notable modern houses for John Rood, Harry A. Blackmun, and Archie Walker, said "It was Carl Graffunder\'s, small, inexpensive house of light-weight concrete blocks and cypress siding that got the most acclaim. The visitors were almost unanimous in saying it was the most unusual. Most of them considered it the most efficiently designed house of the group. Several of them said it was the house they would most like to live in themselves. They were impressed by Graffunder\'s plan, his workmanship and the attractive and practical results. Their comments: \'Fits site and family needs perfectly. No space wasted, yet seems comfortably roomy. Fine use of materials\' . . . \'Unusual because it provides space and amenities in little space and with great quality.\' . . . \'Original design, which fits the needs of his particular family.\' . . . \'Displays the most building ideas and imagination with the budget limitations."

Built on a narrow, irregular site, the design placed patient rooms facing the Mississippi River and Minneapolis skyline, with various service rooms and laboratories cut into the hillside. Subject of a feature in the October 1951 issue of Architectural Record: the program was described as "unique" as it was the only hospital in the United States for the study and teaching of the best methods for treating heard conditions, and the care of chronic heart patients—thus the facilities were heavily loaded on the research side. The capacity was intended with bed for 38 adults and 40 child in-patients, but to also allow for 200 outpatients per day. As a research facility, the interiors were designed with flexibility and changing uses of facilities and space: capped mechanical connections allow classrooms, offices, and conference rooms to be quickly converted into working laboratories Main floor reception room included a large fireplace as well as large windows overlooking the river. The building also included an auditorium for shows, dining, and recreation. The third floor, designed for children, included an enclosed roof terrace as play space with an adjoining indoor playroom. University interior designer Johns Hopkins handled furniture design and color coordination—the structure was noted for fire engine red children\'s bathrooms and closet interiors, adult rooms combining gray and yellow, lots of red in outpatient rooms, and a main reception room in gray, gunmetal, and red. The interior halls included handrails, patient bathrooms had raised bathtubs and handrails, and (where possible) the use of ramps rather than stairs. The structure also featured rooms with recessed concealed oxygen outlets, aspirators in exam rooms, special outlets and equipment arrangements in all bedrooms, and filtered air systems.  As part of a teaching hospital, some exam rooms had benches for student doctors. During construction a 4th floor was added for laboratory facilities after the enlargement of the first floor\'s radiographic space to accommodate new techniques and to add more research space, it shared the same overall footprint of the lower floors (254\'x98\'). The Variety Club raised $464,000 of the $987,000 cost of the heart hospital.

A number of housing experts visited the home in 1950 as part of a local conference (including publishers of leading magazines) and rated the house very highly in an informal poll by the Minneapolis Tribune: "The outside appearance, living room, kitchen and the general decorating effect were liked especially." They cited the exterior\'s "bold lines with solid areas of glass and wood siding. The land falls away on the other side, leaving two stories open to the view. This house was a favorite with architectural experts in Minneapolis recently." The interior features a jutting fireplace, which partly divides the long living room; photo of house was featured by Progressive Architecture chief editor Thomas H. Creighton in his commentary at the end of the September 1950 issue (also known as P/A, the magazine was then the biggest magazine on modernism). Featured in "House Beautiful" magazine (March 1951 and December 1951) as well as "The American House Today" (Reinhold Publishing Company, 1952 same publisher as P/A). Harry Blackmun was hired as general counsel of the Mayo Clinic in 1950 (he served there from 1950-59), forcing the family to move out of the house soon after it was constructed. The Blackmun\'s initially wanted to have the same plans rebuilt in Rochester, but could not find a suitable lot for the plan (they initially moved into the recently completed Mayo Homestead Addition; Long & Thorshov reportedly designed their eventual Rochester home). The next owner, Edward W. Verbarg (1912-2003), was an engineer who ran the Bergstrom-Verbarg Company, an electrical equipment concern; photographs of the home appeared again in the Minneapolis Tribune on July 29, 1951, in a story about the Verbarg\'s adoption of several children from Yugoslavia.'),

The shape meant a nave was not possible, and the sanctuary was integrated. The Parish website of Church Of Christ The King (Cork, Ireland) put together a solid profile of this church. Plans for the structure in Pierre were begun in the 1920s by Father Paul McGuire, but all the funds were lost in the Great Depression; a restarted fund-raising campaign in 1939 raised $50,000, and Fr. McGuire reached out to Byrne after reading an article about him in The Catholic Daily. After Byrne confirmed he could design a church within that budget, he was hired. The exterior uses yellow brick to convey long and uninterrupted walls. These walls slant backward toward the church and each have a series of 4 narrow windows that reduce in size as the walls expand away from the tower. The bell tower has a tall and narrow void originally designed to house a series of bells or statue. In 1960, a series of bells were installed in the void. These were subsequently removed in later years and now stand to one side of the church. The entrance was modified in subsequent years, detracting from the original character.  One criticism of the design is a pair of interior pillars in the central aisle that somewhat reduce visibility; the sanctuary also suffers from bad lighting. Sally Chappell, author of "Barry Byrne: Architecture and Writings," noted the design here is a transition toward the concepts used in his later churches where he abandoned the sanctuary and nave integration in favor of an oval ground plan, e.g. St. Columba (1949) in St. Paul, MN.'),

The organization was headed by attorney J. Stewart McClendon, and Robert G. Cerny, architect associated with Long & Thorshov (later a named partner) and faculty member at the University of Minnesota\'s school of architecture. Relying on a collective effort, members contributed $500 each, $450 of which helped purchase the land. The project was financed by the First National Bank, and prices were initially set from $8,000 (2-bedroom model) to $10,000 (3-bedroom). The group purchasing for the project allowed both access to scarce materials and bulk discounts. Houses were all one-story, and those in the same price class shared identical floorplans. Individual owners were allowed to make their own decisions to roofing, exterior surfacing, and color scheme. Many of the veterans financed their houses with loans from the Veteran Administration or Federal Housing Administration, but it was not a requirement for membership in the association. The original 61-houses were developed between 1946-47 (with 32 started in \'46, and the rest in \'47). The neighborhood was laid out with a curved street (Queen) running down the center. All 61 were built by the Madsen Construction Co. (under Chief Engineer Lyell C. Halverson, who would later start his own company), and designed by Cerny\'s firm, Long & Thorshov. An early sketch and floorplan of a 2-bedroom model was featured in the April 21, 1946 issue of the Minneapolis Tribune.
