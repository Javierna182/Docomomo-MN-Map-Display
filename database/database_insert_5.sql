The program called for one, two, and three-bedroom units for the middle-income rental market, providing the maximum number of units allowable by city zoning regulations. To stay within budget, the structure uses a precast concrete floor system and masonry walls (limiting the height to its present design). The lintel block bond beam, supporting the precast floor units, is expressed on the exterior as a design element. The bearing portions of the walls were expressed as panels with Portland cement stucco panels used below windows. Rigid insulation and sheetrock were glued directly to the inside of the exterior walls, carpeting applied directly to the precast concrete floor, and textured paint sprayed to the underside for the ceiling finish. The original entrance, facing the "court" side of the building, originally featured an entry canopy with decorative masonry sides. Units were designed to maximize views, with the river on the north and a landscaped pool court and residential area to the south. Total structure cost was $641,935, with landscaping, swimming pool, driveway and parking lot adding $13,500. The official cost-per-square foot was $9.95. Later converted into condominiums.

The firm was given the program of designing a library for a community of then-10,000 with equal amenity access for vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles, with an interior arranged for efficiency and flexibility in control and staff, and for a programmable area for a variety of interests within library operations; the sit was ad the northern edge of the town\'s central business district, as it transitions to single-family residences. The architects opted to orient the approach towards the south and east, with parking areas for vehicles and bicycles and a small green area to form the approach. The building positions the work areas, utility spaces, public facilities, and meeting rooms to the south, with the main single reading room extending across the north. Areas for reading, reference, and book storage were arranged to be visible from the control desk near the entrance. Per the architects, the design used "A laminated wood roof system carried on 8" brick masonry piers which are encaged to walls forming \'U\' shaped alcove enclosures. Inasmuch as there are not good views to the outside, the building is essentially enclosed, with the exception of one large opening, which is provided to the east, primarily for exterior contact with library activities. The bays step upward to higher ceilings at the west end of the main reading room to provide sufficient height for a future stack mezzanine. This requirement evolved the solution of the stepped-bay unit. Glare problems for the high clerestory glass areas on the south are eliminated by the use of low-transmission light and heat reflected glass. The finishes consist of structural laminated wood members, striated wood deck, face brick, quarry tile and carpet. Copper cladding protects the exterior surfaces of the laminated wood roof system. Heading, cooling and ventilation are by a central multi-zone air handling unit."

Saarinen (noted critic), John MacLane Johansen, Robert L. Geddes, John Skilling (engineer), and Paul M. Rudolph) did not issue a First Design Award to a single, top design and instead noted the 5 that received the higher-level award were all superior (not all categories had Award projects rather than the lower ranked Citations). The jury felt Rapson\'s design displayed the firm hand of a disciplined program, which stood in quiet contrast to most of the entries in the Religion category, where the jurors noted "There is a tendency in that field to be so personally expressionistic and heady." Rapson\'s approach made the existing chapel and new mausoleum form the visual axis of the design, filling the space between them with terraces, sunken courts, pools, and garden crypt areas in an asymmetrical arrangement; mausoleum as entry points from the garden court level and street above; additional burial crypts were dispersed throughout the gardens, "where groups of them form sunken garden courts, niches, or walls." The P/A jury felt it was "Extremely orderly and controlled architectural planning, though termed by one jury member as \'too obvious and too axial.\' On the whole, the jury admired the progression of spaces and the sensitive interplay of architecture and landscape." Anyway, this was tossed aside for something safer by Detroit-based Harley, Ellington, Cowan & Stirton.

Woodsy modern style house with shingled walls. Featured in a March 1970 ad (in the AIA Journal) by the Red Cedar Shingle & Handsplit Shake Bureau for its use of red cedar shingles. The street side hides the size of the house, which sprawls towards the back and opens up to the yard with many southern facing windows with passive solar elements to keep out the summer sun. Many windows, clerestory windows, and a layout that keeps the two bedroom wings (master suite + study; the 3 children\'s bedrooms + play areas) easily separable from the public areas of the house. The center of the house is for public entertaining, and entirely oriented towards the southern exposure: The entry hallway opens to a space intended for a piano that transitions into the open living room; a dining room is at the center of the public areas, separating the living room and the family room with large brick fireplace and built in closets shielding it from the hallway to the children\'s wing. The kitchen sits in a position at the middle of the house off the dining (with passthrough) and living rooms, but is very well lit by a large dome skylight. The children\'s bedroom wing is at the back of the house, with three bedrooms all featuring built-in desks and closets around a central playroom; the playroom is connected to the house\'s partial basement by a spiral staircase: below is a large entertainment room (with pool table) and several mechanical and storage rooms (including what may have originally been a primary laundry room); the basement is only accessible via the spiral staircase, with some clerestory windows in the entertainment room. The master suite is at the front of the house, with a large study on the lower floor and a spiral staircase up to master bedroom suite (the only part of the second floor); the master bedroom is large, features an expansive and handsome closet area with sink, but (and a big but) one of the smallest master bathrooms ever seen (compact arrangement of sink & toilet on one side facing an undersized tub/shower combo).  The dining room and playroom are well lit by very high ceilings that allow for clerestory windows. The AIA MN awards jury noted: "The exterior of this immediately engaging. The interior is less immediately so, yet, examination reveals a careful disposition of rooms and levels, and variations of volume, light and view that have made much of an unexceptional site." The 1970 AIA MN awards jury that year comprised noted figures: Prof. Stanford Anderson, 1934-2016 (MIT); structural engineer William LeMessurier, 1926-2007 (famed for fixing Citicorp Center); Prof. William Southworth (MIT); Charles W. Moore, FAIA, 1925-93 (AIA Gold Medal, \'91); and chaired by Prof. Donlyn Lyndon (UC Berkeley; co-designer of Sea Ranch). It is of note that Lyndon was on the jury, as the house has some echoes of what made Sea Ranch such a seminal development in modern residential architecture, while also adhering to the style of clean lines and well-thought out spaces that Parker brought to his other residential works. Designed by Leonard Parker while he was still operating as "Leonard Parker, Architect" (Parker Klein & Assoc. was formed in March 1968, which was named in the 1970 AIA MN Award of Merit). Built by Paul Larson Construction Company. Goodmans were a married couple who were both doctors. Malka Lotterstein Goodman (1929-2022) and Ernest "Ernie" Goodman (d.2014) met in Bologna, Italy while both were studying medicine; they moved to St. Paul in 1953. Malka earned her medical degree from the University of Minnesota and became a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Ernie was an obstetrician, helped start the Parkview Obstetrics & Gynecology practice, and rose to be United Hospital\'s Chief of Staff. The Goodmans were philanthropists that gave to the Jewish Community Center (also designed by Parker), Temple of Aaron Synagogue, and Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. The house went on the market for the first time in March 2023 and was in very good condition.'),

Extra services like the kitchens, teaching space, elevators and the rest are outside this patient circle. So the nurse is not distracted by noise or walking distance normal in a hospital. The circle plan means either better care or fewer nurses--there’s no question about that." Ellerbe would then employ the design at other hospitals such as Ancker and St. Luke in St. Paul as well as the full Methodist Hospital in a cloverleaf design: the 570-bed hospital used a combination of double and single corridor wards on the same floor with circular units, partially funded by federal and state grants. The $14M, 5-story permanent structure features radial (circular) nursing units on the east with the more conventional cross on the west, but the west side also was designed for experiments with double, single, and cross-corridors.

Featured in the Minneapolis Tribune (06/30/1968) as an example of \'California living,\' Minnesota style." Built around an open, L-shaped courtyard (roofed only by a trellis to cut on glare), with sliding doors from the adjacent rooms; the courtyard included an outdoor dining area, walkway, decorative pool, and live plantings with evergreens. Richard Lundgren stated the house was "zoned for parents and children" so his 3 kids could have their own separate area (paralleling the long leg of the courtyard). The master bedroom, living room, and dining room were arranged on the north side with sliding glass doors opening onto a double-deck plank patio (the house is walk-out on the north side) facing a small pond. The lower level of the walk-out consisted of a game room (with compact kitchen behind an accordion door) and Lundgren\'s office. The master bath had a concealed shower, inside what the Tribune called a "curlicue." The living room was designed with built-ins including a permanent island table as a back-up to the sofa, with cabinet space the full length of it. A fireplace separates the living and dining rooms, with a barbecue built into the back section of the fireplace facing the dining room. The game room featured a conversation pit, featuring brown cork walls and an old brick fireplace. Lundgren\'s wife noted "We like casual living, and that\'s what our house was planned for." She noted "This is not a spit-and-polish house. Everything is rough-sawn, so there\'s nothing that needs to be polished and shined. And it\'s strictly functional. There are no false beams or pillars. Everything is there for a reason--it\'s holding something up" adding it was designed for its occupants, "not for somebody driving by on the street. We don\'t have any facade on the front. The back [north] is the pretty side, with all the windows" Richard Lundgren implemented a variety of woods, noting "the painter mixed and matched to get a smoky walnut tone throughout." The woods used were cedar plywood, cedar boards, western red cedar planking, hemlock planking, birch (built-ins, doors), Douglas fir (posts and beams), fir planks (bookshelves, the only smooth-finished wood used for easy dusting); redwood (board walk and deck), cedar strips (sunshade in courtyard), and oak planks for the stairway. Garnered a Western Wood Products Association award in 1967 for effective use of wood. Original address: 5900 62nd St W. Lundgren would soon move to 5305 63rd St W.'),

First featured in an article on new building techniques in June 1968 issue of Progressive Architecture (P/A, then the biggest magazine on modernism): it uses a staggered truss system to reduce the amount (thus cost) of steel in a 17-story, 18-unit senior public housing project. Developed by the Departments of Architecture and Civil Engineering at MIT, the "system spaces story-high trusses in a similar pattern to brickwork joints. Floors span continuously between alternate top chords and bottom chords of trusses that span between exterior columns. Trusses are spaced 22\'-8" apart, and their diagonals serve as wind bracing in the short direction of the building. Steel weight is reported to be 7 psf, and a comparable braced frame is estimated at 9 psf." Featured in a January 1969 ad (in P/A) for U.S. Steel (which had sponsored the research program at MIT), highlighting the cost-savings it offered ($59,580 below budget). Also featured in a February 1969 ad (P/A) for Spancrete, as the steel system required "a thin, rigid flooring system that would transfer wind loads on a horizontal plane from one truss to the other. Six inch-thick Spancrete planks with only eight inches between floor and ceiling proved to be the answer. The Spancrete planks span a 23-foot area, allowing for flexible apartment plans." Mentioned again in P/A\'s October 1969 report documenting the evolution of steel over the past decade, "trusses were prefabbed in pieces in special jigs - welded on one side, then flipped and welded on the other" and reportedly reduced the amount of steel by 20%.

Exterior in face brick, Winona stone, aluminum, and architectural concrete. Planned with lobby, administration, maintenance, and public areas on the ground floor, and 120 units above. Architect Wayne Smith planned a compact design to keep no apartment door more than 12 feet from a stairway or elevator; the design condensed corridor space, efficiently grouped services and utilities, and attempted to minimize heat loss through outside exposure. Budgeted at $1,875,908. Rochester architects Joseph J. Weichselbaum and Richard A. Brehmer were brought in by the HRA to inspect during construction. Developed by the Mississippi Development Consortium, made up of 5-firms comprising 4 construction companies (Nels Johnson Construction Co., P. Earl Schwab Co., Fowler & Hammer, Inc., and WMC, Inc.) and W-Smith Architectural & Engineering Service. The first in a wave of low-income housing projects in Minnesota that were developed as part of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development\'s Turnkey Housing Program, which inadvertently influenced the trend towards the architect-developer by finding that architects who act as developers on Turnkey projects turn out "better-than-average" housing--resulting in HUD urging district offices "to use architects as developers whenever possible." The HRA negotiated with the development groups to furnish a completed structure at an agreed sale price, leaving the developers to obtain the site and handle all details involved in construction. The Winona HRA was offered 3 plans: what became the present project, a 17-story, more squarish structure on 4th St between Market & Franklin designed by Eckert & Carlson, and a 12-story building offering a mix of traditional designs and a mansard roof on Main Street & Broadway by St. Paul developer Andrews Allen Co. The current plan was selected on the fifth ballot after a 2-hour deadlock (on 3 preceding voices, the board tied between the current plan and the 17-story plan by Eckert). Part of what ultimately won over the HRA was the appearance, and that it could hold additional units via an additional floor (if needed), as well as the location that offered better possibilities for future expansion. At one point, the 13th floor was inserted into the plan (adding 10 more units). The HRA asked the public for suggestions for the name (for no prize), and got a dozen workable options, however none were the selected name. Planning began in January 1967, construction began on January 12, 1968, and it was dedicated on March 29, 1969 with the move-in for the first occupant (Mrs. Emma Prigge) on April 1, 1969.'),

The structure was notable for being build, start-to-finish in 120-days using large sections of precast, pre-stressed concrete—the first of this style built in downtown (though the technique had been used in the suburbs). Caissons to support the building began in December 1968. The approach was what architect Gerrish described as a "sophisticated system" developed between he and Spancrete Midwest Co. that had not been previously used before. The concrete panels were separate by tinted glass, with natural brick paving used in the entrances. The 5-story, $1M building was designed with 52,200sf, with 1,000sf on the first floor, which otherwise had space for 48 cars under the building, which was elevated on 10-foot columns. Each of the upper four floors had approximately 12,885sf each. Owner/Builder: Knutson Const. Scheduled for demolition, however not without a preservation effort in 2020—a first for a building of this vintage. Also striking was an earlier effort to have it demolished in the mid-2000s faced no opposition because buildings from this era were not seen as historically notable (that project was scuttled due to the Great Recession, this building was known as the Dolphin Staffing building at that time).'),

Designed on a steep slope: the main entrance is across a bridge that crosses a steep slop to the main entrance on the 4th floor; the side facing the river presents 10 floors (described as 9.5 in contemporary articles on the construction). The first Twin Cities applicant to a wave of low-income housing projects in Minnesota that were developed as part of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development\'s Turnkey Housing Program, which inadvertently influenced the trend towards the architect-developer by finding that architects who act as developers on Turnkey projects turn out "better-than-average" housing--resulting in HUD urging district offices "to use architects as developers whenever possible." The HRA negotiated with the development groups to furnish a completed structure at an agreed sale price, leaving the developers to obtain the site and handle all details involved in construction. HUD funded the $1.97M project, shepherded by then-Sen. Walter F. Mondale. Daniel L. Dworsky (1927-2022) was a Los Angeles-based architect who was born in Minneapolis and grew up between MN and SD before going to college in Michigan (where he also starred in football); he and his firm did several projects in the Twin Cities. Owner: South St Paul Housing & Redevelopment Authority; builder: William H. Weitzman & Associates. The development attracted bids from 8 Twin Cities metro developers. Including designs by Cavin and Page, Cerny Assoc., Horan-Hustad, Gregory E. Clayon & Assoc., and Trossen, Wright, Prokasky & Sullivan. In an unusual hiccup, the HRA first selected the 14-story project presented by Bor-Son Building Corp. (designed by Cavin and Page) for a location at Southview Blvd. & 17th Ave. S., only to immediately drop it when it became apparent that the site wasn\'t correctly zoned and the process to rezone would jeopardize the HUD funding that relied on a July 1968 groundbreaking. This opened the path for William H. Weitzman & Associates to move forward with their plan with Dworsky Associates doing the design. Named after the executive director of the South St. Paul HRA, and later head of the Dakota County HRA, Nan McKay; this probably occurred in the 1980s. '),

Shingled townhomes facing Lake Minnetonka, designed in a simple adaptation of the Cape Cod cottage idea, comprising three buildings with 15 townhouses and 5 one-level apartments. All were originally rentals. Architect Robert G. Cerny considered the development the first physical evidence of a grand scheme he had promoted for a decade, stating "I’m concerned that people in this metropolitan area still think in terms of a small town. I don\'t think the understand that a lot of older persons have money and would like quality living quarters without the responsibility of maintaining a large yard, particularly since many of them are gone for two months in the winter. What I\'m trying to stimulate in the creation of what I would call a high-quality luxury bedroom community in Excelsior and Wayzata, where they could have a fine apartment, a little private garden and their boat or yacht right in front." Cerny envisioned tenants mooring boats in the front yard and living a lifestyle similar to Cape Cod or Sausalito; he also saw the nearby amusement park eventually being phased out in favor of a large apartment tower, more sophisticated row house units, and a restaurant over the lake, adding "I think you\'ve got to create an environment in which purchasing power of the proper kind (residents with money) will bring in a response from commerce." The project was developed by amusement park owner Fred W. Pearce of Detroit, who was interested in Cerny\'s ideas. When it opened the rents were between $180-$275 per month.

Though remodeled inside, the original house exterior was kept, purportedly to fit in the neighborhood (part of what got the Merit Award) but the argument rings a bit false considering it was already packed with mid-century design, including the former personal homes of modernists Robert Cerny and Roy Thorshov on the south, two houses by Carl Graffunder across the street, and the Harold Deutsch House designed by Close Assoc. just to the north! Still, the addition was created as an activity center for the family. Hodne first rented the original house to see if he liked it, then bought it and began renovating the original section while living in the basement; the addition then came via a hallway: bottom level contains a garage, sauna, a cold-water jump-in pool, 2nd level has a basketball court (a sport court years before they were popular!) as well as a dining area with seating for 8 (Hodnes had 7 kids), above the dining room and looking down on the double-height basketball court was a loft.

The site was previously the 25-acre Jensen farm. At the time, LBI was a layman\'s training school, sending many students to enter the foreign mission field, with 400 fulltime students and 7,000 correspondence students. At the 1956 announcement, the architect mentioned was Lang and Raugland, however this soon shifted: Hammel & Green designed an elaborate campus master plan concept of four major academic buildings connected with a glass-enclosed walk around a 7-sided chapel with a roof similar to Ralph Rapson\'s celebrated St. Peter\'s Lutheran Church (1958) in Edina; behind them were set various dormitory buildings for a student body of 660; the firm included the concept plan in a monograph of its recent work featured in the May-June 1959 issue of Northwest Architect. The plan was significantly altered, with the academic buildings combined into one 234\'x135\', two-story structure housing classrooms, cafeteria, library, faculty and administrative offices, as well as an auditorium-gymnasium with stage. Only two of the proposed eight 2-story dormitory buildings were built with both housing women (both were demolished in the late 2000s). The initial project cost $1,750,000. At the time it opened in 1961, LBI presidents Eugene V. Stime and the Rev. Bernt C. Opsal stated the architectural theme of the campus was the "Christian\'s shield of faith" with the walls of the two dormitories and main building made up of shields with a cross as a part of the design. A Dormitory-Commons building was constructed in the southeast corner of the property in 1966 (still extant). In 1967 became the private two-year junior college renamed Golden Valley Lutheran College. The college closed in 1985, and the campus was converted into The Minnesota Center for Arts Education (later renamed the Perpich Center for Arts Education).

This one was developed in conjunction with department store rival Donaldson\'s (and its parent company, NYC-based Allied Stores Corp.), which originally owned the property; like the previous two Dales, it was built with the town-square concept developed by Victor Gruen and Associates. Approved in July 1966; developed on a 55-acre parcel, the 600,000 square foot structure cost an estimated $12,000,000 to develop and construction took 15 months from 1968-69. The initial approach to design was "a classical architectural creation which uses mammoth amounts of stone and mortar for an impressive, quiet exterior beauty, while offering a highly functional opportunity for interior spaciousness." The original interior layout was a straight-line, with Donaldson\'s department store anchoring one end (east) and Dayton\'s at the other (west) with 2-levels of shops in between. On the inside, both department stores were fronted by courtyards with fountains and large, multi-globed light displays suspended above them. The middle of the mall featured a garden court, with escalators, and four bridges crossing on the second level; a large, four-faced clock was hung above the up- and down-escalators in the center; the interior landscaping featured bushes, trees, and flowering plants. The idea of encircling the structure with 10 parking lots (3,476 cars) was promoted as an efficient layout that "saves steps" ("the next best thing to moving sidewalks"). The mall is surrounded by a perimeter road system and designed to take advantage of highway construction nearby. As most malls of the era, it was designed with second and third phases planned out. Donaldson\'s originally housed 172,834 square feet over 3-floors; Dayton\'s 189,118 square feet over two floors and a "downstairs floor" (the only part of the mall that was initially below the first level). The third largest store was local clothier Young-Quinlan (30,000sf), with other large spaces occupied by Woolworth\'s, Liemandt\'s, Newmans and Buttreys. The original stores included 82 stores, 15 were new to the Twin Cities (both national chains with their first outlet in the metro, and opened by local business people). Among the national chains that opened their first location in Rosedale were Bresler\'s 33 Flavors (Chicago-based ice cream parlor), National Uniforms, Stuarts (women\'s apparel), Interior Systems (furniture), Swiss Colony (gourmet food), Regal Shoes and Junior Shoeland, and Tobaccoland. Among the local companies, General Mills opened a bakery (Sweet Street), Dayton\'s opened travel agency (Dayton\'s Travel Service) and clothing store aimed at trendy fashions (d\'finity). 56% of the original tenant areas were devoted to fashion merchandise. A community room with a 400-person capacity was included. Opened on Friday, August 15, 1969; it featured a reported 150,000 roses in pink, red, yellow, white, mauve, orange, and "fluorescent" orange colors that were all arranged in arches, hedges, urns, vases, and in mosaic patterns on 32-foot obelisks. The original logo was a styled rose surrounded by a cluster of capital-R\'s. The site originally comprised 150-acres that were purchased by Donaldson\'s in 1952 for a never-realized shopping center; in the intervening years, the Apache Plaza (1961-2004) and Har-Mar shopping center (1963) were developed nearby. In September 1962, Donaldson\'s-Golden Rule announced plans to build the second-largest mall in the Twin Cities on the site, with their own store (their largest in the suburbs) serving as anchor (this original plan showed an L-shaped layout with the anchor at the elbow); the plan was to break ground in 1963 on an estimated $7M project and open in 1965 with more than 500,000sf of space. The intersection of Highway 36 and Snelling became a center of retail, with the Har-Mar Mall (1963), the first stand-alone Target store (1962, also owned by Dayton\'s; replaced with a Super Target), and Rosedale Shopping Mall (1969). The decision to join in the development of what became Rosedale was made by the Dayton Development Co. after studies indicated the northern Ramsey County could support another mall. A northwest wing addition was added in 1976-77, comprising 20-stores (166,000sf) and anchored by a J.C. Penney store. A second major addition on the southeast (154,000sf) and anchored by a Montgomery Ward was added in 1979. The original Dayton\'s was replaced by a 4-level (259,400sf) store just west of the original in 1991 (a similar replacement was done for the Dayton\'s in the original Southdale Center). Substantial subsequent additions and alterations: in 2005 the original Donaldson\'s was demolished for an extension anchored by a large multiplex cinema, the majority of this wing was designed with outdoor-only entrances, despite the intense winter climate that spurred Gruen to make the Dales indoor malls to begin with.'),

The initial budget was $360,000, though the initial design was estimated to cost $430,000 due to increases in the cost of construction; the slanted-roof structure was inspired by the poem The Song of Hiawatha by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (as did the name Nokomis) and the Native American teepee. The design, specifically attributed to Harold F. Schroeder, used brown, dark red, and earthy colors to draw on those inspirations, and an open interior with a small pool of water; high placed windows to private different light patters at various times of the day. Schroeder designed a round glass and stone building with a pitched roof to be that modern-day teepee. It was planned along with the conversion of Ralph Rapson\'s State Capitol Credit Union into the Southeast Community Library, including challenging each other for budget demands (they were the first new branches in the system in 35 years). The interior features a hexagonal orientation, and was noted for the free-form balcony over the checkout desk that was designed as a storytelling area, accessibly via a slightly-spiral staircase. The fireplace was designed with Mankato stone and was designed for use with gas. Schroeder stated "We designed this to blend in with the neighborhood. And for People. That\'s why chairs and tables are near the windows. The book stacks are centered. We want people looking in to see people, not just books. We looked for an idea that said something definite about this area." As it was close enough to Minnehaha Falls to fit into the Longfellow legend of Hiawatha, "This building would be out of context anywhere else in town. Indian folklore is a part of the history around here." Builder: Lyell C. Halverson Co. The architecture critic of The Minneapolis Star, Peter Altman, was not as impressed by the functionality of the design, which he called "the most distinctive architecturally, but it is a nervous building that contains too many materials and irregularities to be sufficiently promotive of contemplation." The critic apparently hated any and all sound. In comparing it to a wave of mid-1960s libraries in Hennepin County, where he strongly preferred separation of noisy elements and children, noting that the hexagonal layout "in which the center of the building is taken up with card catalogues and checkout desks. No matter where you sit you are bothered by noise from these facilities. Nokomis\' problem is compounded by the presence in its midst of a \'wind and water chime,\' a sculpture with running water and tinkling brass bits that keeps attracting attention. And Nokomis also contains a raised area for children\'s story hours, a lovely idea except that it is right in the center of the building and during readings would be inescapable." However, the critic approved of the exterior: thanks to extensive use of glass, makes the most lively impression from outside." The critic had a hatred for gas fireplaces. Renovated in 2011. The lobby featured a hanging sculpture by Macalester College art professor Donald Celender (1931-2005), Wind and Water Chime (c.1968), over a water feature; the stabile (similar to a mobile but not intended to move) comprises 4,000 individual components, including small brass and phosphorus bronze rectangles strung on 600 yards (549 m) of filament lines. The installation was intended to evoke the nearby Minnehaha Falls, which, like Nokomis, was referenced in Longfellow\'s The Song of Hiawatha. The piece was restored during the renovation and now hangs near the building\'s entrance on the library\'s west side.'),

To divide the interior space, the library subtly created enclaves via low, widely spaced bookshelves, to which Altman noted "The enclosed nooks created have pleasingly varied shapes despite the building\'s rigid rectilinearity."

Design brochures developed by the Post Office Department in the late 1950s and early 1960s guided the contract-built "Thousand Series" small post offices around the country (the name refers to building size: 1,000-12,000 sf). After sites were determined, the lease-purchase program would select developers through a competitive bid process based on the lowest bid. Bidders would choose designs from the U.S Postal Service\'s 1959 "Building Design" brochure, which stressed modernity and convenience over regional identity or the role of the federal government in everyday life. The resulting buildings were usually not designed by architects, but by the construction contractor using the brochure renderings and guidelines for reference. The brochure offered "acceptable" designs, with Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield asserting his desire that post offices be built as Modern buildings focusing on efficiency and clean lines. The International Style was predominant, calling mostly for flat roofs, exterior wall materials of aluminum or stainless-steel framed window walls with stone, face brick, or precast concrete. The brochures noted that the designs were adaptable to many variations and site characteristics, and because exterior design and materials could be adjusted to suit local conditions, suitable for all climates and geographical areas in the United States. While the designs were easy for local builders and contractors to follow, the lack of an architect in the construction process did affect the design quality of the completed building, and often resulted in small post offices that were a-contextual and stylistically homogeneous (emphasizing economy over creativity).

The brutalist, contemporary style is in line with the existing campus, which the magazine noted possesses "a strong physical character to reflect the nature of its use." The building facilities comprise 2 groupings, dictated somewhat by the sloping lot (with a fall of 35ft, it was the most difficult problem affecting the budget): on the end closest to the main campus and offering easiest student and public access, the upper level comprises varsity and practice playing floors, auxiliary gems, spectator seating, handball courts, gymnastics room, wrestling room, and dance studio. The lower level comprises swimming pools (with spectator seating), locker rooms, administrative offices, classrooms, storage and custodial areas. The upper and lower levels are connected with lobbies to allow for easy circulation (e.g. between locker rooms and playing floors). The building was designed to be accessible for students in wheelchairs with ramp access to all levels, as well as an elevator. On the exterior, the upper level uses mostly load-bearing construction with reinforced concrete and exposed precast concrete tee suspended slabs, exposed steel joists, and steel roof deck; the lower level uses a concrete skeleton system with exposed steel pan floor and roof construction.

Featured in the October 1965 issue of Progressive Architecture (then the biggest magazine on modernism), as part of an examination of modern approaches to theater design. Auditorium and theater are joined through a common stagehouse; a 20-ton sound-isolating wall divides the auditorium from the theater so both may be used simultaneously. Raising the acoustic wall and closing off the forestage of the theater gives the auditorium use of the stagehouse.  The 2 lifts in the auditorium may be raised to add thrust to the proscenium stage. Auditorium designed to seat 1000, plus an addition 200 if the lifts were at floor level; theater designed with 350-seats and a traditional proscenium stage when its single lift is at floor level. The walls of both theater and auditorium are a combination of brick, wood, and fiber mesh. A small 120-seat theater (the arena) located on the lower level, is also part of this arts center. It was Green\'s first theater design, he noted "Theater design is just beginning to develop and react to new thinking, which makes it extremely interesting. Further, it involves large and small volume, not necessarily dictated by efficiency analyses."

Post Office',E'Unknown',E'1968',E'Larger postal facility may have been beyond the "Thousand Series" Post Office, but follows the general push of that program (may have used an architect); the distinguishing feature is barrel vaulting over the entrance. Part of the major shift in how the U.S. Postal Service operated in the post-War era: To expand quickly, the Post Office pushed a $1.5 billion privately financed lease-purchase program with local developers. Design brochures developed by the Post Office Department in the late 1950s and early 1960s guided the contract-built "Thousand Series" small post offices around the country (the name refers to building size: 1,000-12,000 sf). After sites were determined, the lease-purchase program would select developers through a competitive bid process based on the lowest bid. Bidders would choose designs from the U.S Postal Service\'s 1959 "Building Design" brochure, which stressed modernity and convenience over regional identity or the role of the federal government in everyday life. The resulting buildings were usually not designed by architects, but by the construction contractor using the brochure renderings and guidelines for reference. The brochure offered "acceptable" designs, with Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield asserting his desire that post offices be built as Modern buildings focusing on efficiency and clean lines. The International Style was predominant, calling mostly for flat roofs, exterior wall materials of aluminum or stainless-steel framed window walls with stone, face brick, or precast concrete. The brochures noted that the designs were adaptable to many variations and site characteristics, and because exterior design and materials could be adjusted to suit local conditions, suitable for all climates and geographical areas in the United States. While the designs were easy for local builders and contractors to follow, the lack of an architect in the construction process did affect the design quality of the completed building, and often resulted in small post offices that were a-contextual and stylistically homogeneous (emphasizing economy over creativity). There was notably no emphasis on landscaping. The topic is explored in the "USPS Nationwide Historic Context Study: Postal Facilities Constructed or Occupied Between 1940 and 1971" (URS Group, Inc. prepared for U.S. Postal Service, September 2012.).'),

The original master plan was a ladder-shape building plan, with 4 parallel wings connected by hallways running on across the north (enclosed) and south (open-hallway), with 3 courtyards formed in between; the initial building phase constructed the middle two units: one for worship and one for education/administrative purposes; the worship space would then be supplanted by a much larger church building on the far west, and a fellowship hall on the far east side. Neither happened: instead, the courtyard between the first two wings was filled in for the new sanctuary. The new sanctuary is modern, and features a skillion roof with clerestory windows on the east side. An addition has also been added to the south. Design was credited to partner O. Reuben Johnson. The church features a unique piece of artwork outside: a 21-foot free-standing cross, which originally stood in front of the main entrance, features a 12-foot horizontal bar (in a somewhat diamond/trapezoidal shape) filled with colored glass that was meant to represent Christ\'s transfiguration before 3 of his disciples, where "His garments shone like the sun"; designed by Grant Gildehus, vice president of Sacred Design Associates, Inc. with glass work by August Molder. After the church was remodeled in a radical departure from the original plan, the cross was moved to a spot just off the northeast corner of the structure.'),

The completed model was published in January 20, 1964 edition of The Minneapolis Star. Phase 1 was featured as one of several current projects in the January-February 1966 issue of Northwest Architect. Low, swampy land constituted one half of the 1100\'x332\' site, at what was then the rural edge of town. The building was arranged in a complex of 3 parallel wings (with gymnasium and cafeteria in the center), connected by an off-center perpendicular hallway, to provide open courtyards: this arrangement allowed the convent to have easy accessibility to the school while also providing private indoor-outdoor areas for the sisters one side, while the other large courtyard was used by both the school and for social events by the church community. Structurally the building uses steel column, laminated wood beam, and decking roof systems were used. Other materials were chosen for both low maintenance and "to provide visual strength, warmth and softness" with Chicago common brick, concrete walls and walks (both board texture and exposed aggregate), flooring both brick and carpeted, aluminum sliding doors and casement windows in black, and copper sheathed fascia and high wall surfaces. At the time of completion, Phase 1 comprised 32,150sf with 13,375sf of courtyards. At some point after construction, part of one of the larger courtyards was replaced with a structure. '),

He handed the design to respected builder, Hugh Thorson Const. Co. (who had experience creating homes for architects), and the house was built to his design, with large windows and flat roof (but not the usual parapet of his chosen style, though it did have roof ornamentation flanking the door and corners), and featured in a 1963 piece in the Minneapolis Tribune; it originally featured a 7.5ft-wide art gallery, with walls of Japanese grasscloth, that served a triple purpose: the home entry way, dividing area between living and sleeping areas, as well as displaying Holmberg\'s work as an amateur painter; Holmberg particularly hated mid-century fireplaces, decrying in the \'63 article that "The worst thing in Minneapolis homes is the fireplace. So many attractive homes around here are ruined by an abortion of a fireplace." Thus, the fireplace he designed was a simple black slate surround, lacking a mantle. In a supreme irony, the man who hated modern houses so much... accidentally designed a modern house: a later owner simply stripped the cosmetic ornamentation, and Holmberg\'s floorplan (seen in modern houses with a central hall) let a future owner easily add a large, shed-roof addition to the back (creating a U-shape footprint); the central gallery still exists; as of a 2020 sale the house is clean-line modern, with a generic stacked stone fireplace façade with mantle above...

Bidders would choose designs from the U.S Postal Service\'s 1959 "Building Design" brochure, which stressed modernity and convenience over regional identity or the role of the federal government in everyday life. The resulting buildings were usually not designed by architects, but by the construction contractor using the brochure renderings and guidelines for reference. The brochure offered "acceptable" designs, with Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield asserting his desire that post offices be built as Modern buildings focusing on efficiency and clean lines. The International Style was predominant, calling mostly for flat roofs, exterior wall materials of aluminum or stainless-steel framed window walls with stone, face brick, or precast concrete. The brochures noted that the designs were adaptable to many variations and site characteristics, and because exterior design and materials could be adjusted to suit local conditions, suitable for all climates and geographical areas in the United States. While the designs were easy for local builders and contractors to follow, the lack of an architect in the construction process did affect the design quality of the completed building, and often resulted in small post offices that were a-contextual and stylistically homogeneous (emphasizing economy over creativity). There was notably no emphasis on landscaping.
