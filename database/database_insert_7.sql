Belfrey took a Small Business Administration (SBA) loan but battled the Minneapolis Housing Redevelopment Authority (HRA) on locating his restaurant on Lyndale; then the HRA demolished the buildings around him where his clientele lived. The unsettled neighborhood hurt business pushed him into arrears on the SBA loan as well as behind on state taxes; despite community efforts to help him turn around the business (including local banks and advertisers), the SBA foreclosed on him in 1979 and the restaurant shut down. The city bought the building at auction in 1980 with plans of expanding the adjacent Lyn Park neighborhood, but ended up letting it be turned into a new barbecue/creole restaurant with a mild Casablanca theme: Rick\'s Cafe Americana. The deal garnered controversy for the owner\'s connections to city government (Harry Davis, a member of the school board). Rick\'s Cafe quickly ran into financial trouble and was 3 months behind on rent after 14 months in business; it reopened in September 1985 under new ownership, but didn\'t last long (closed in 1987).

The resort was originally founded by Wilford H. (better known as Captain Billy) Fawcette, a magazine publisher and, during Breezy Point\'s heyday in the 1920s-30s, it was considered one of Minnesota\'s largest and swankiest resorts, with guests like Sinclair Lewis (the future Noble Laureate wrote part of 1926\'s Elmer Gantry while sipping bootleg gin), Jack Dempsey, Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, etc. spending summers on the beaches on Big Pelican Lake. A "million-dollar fire" in June 1959 burned down the entire 58-room main building and annex, leading to the economic collapse of the 360-acre resort (which reportedly never turned a profit due to its 3-month profit window). A succession of owners tried to revive it, first by subdividing the property into private cabin sites in 1961, and aiming the resort at less affluent customers so it could become a self-sufficient community. In 1963 the resort was purchased by glamourous husband-wife team of Ginny Simms and Don Eastvold. The new owners built an array of new structures: Marina, Motor Inn, and Co-Op Lodge Apartment, of which the latter survives. The first of the new buildings, the Co-Op Lodge Apartment was originally developed as a 50-unit condominium on the site of the former Lodge, and advertised as "the show place of the Pine Country" and "the only country club lodge-apartment of its kind in all of Mid-America." It was built with Boyne Falls Logs from the Boyne Falls Log Home Company of Michigan. The apartments each had living room, bedroom, kitchen, full bath, and storage; the 2-wing structure was connected by bridge to an A-frame lodge across the parking lot (bridge no longer extant, but lodge is). The ownership model was vaguely like a condo-hotel (ownership of the unit, splitting income from the rental while not in use), reportedly the first in the state of Minnesota to allow that model after a change in state law. The subsequent 1960s lodge structures (all since replaced) featured the Modelog system, devised by milling firm Cannaday & Sons on Lake Coeur d\'Alene, Idaho in 1947. Precision planed in cylindrical forms, the patented process allowed for interlocking of logs and the construction of a solid, weather-tight wall which requires no additional interior plaster or wallboard. Modelog, Inc. organized in December 13, 1949. Simms, a singer and actress of modest note in the big band era, had previously been married to the founder of Hyatt Hotels (1945-51); Don Eastvold, former Washington State attorney general, was her third husband from 1962 until her death in 1994 – they nearly split during the re-development of Breezy Point, opting to stay together after filing for divorce in 1963.'),

The builder of this particular example had some fun with a sawtooth-wall on the west side, intermixing longer walls of patterned brick with small window insets. Part of the major shift in how the U.S. Postal Service operated in the post-War era: To expand quickly, the Post Office pushed a $1.5 billion privately financed lease-purchase program with local developers. Design brochures developed by the Post Office Department in the late 1950s and early 1960s guided the contract-built "Thousand Series" small post offices around the country (the name refers to building size: 1,000-12,000 sf). After sites were determined, the lease-purchase program would select developers through a competitive bid process based on the lowest bid. Bidders would choose designs from the U.S Postal Service\'s 1959 "Building Design" brochure, which stressed modernity and convenience over regional identity or the role of the federal government in everyday life. The resulting buildings were usually not designed by architects, but by the construction contractor using the brochure renderings and guidelines for reference. The brochure offered "acceptable" designs, with Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield asserting his desire that post offices be built as Modern buildings focusing on efficiency and clean lines. The International Style was predominant, calling mostly for flat roofs, exterior wall materials of aluminum or stainless-steel framed window walls with stone, face brick, or precast concrete. The brochures noted that the designs were adaptable to many variations and site characteristics, and because exterior design and materials could be adjusted to suit local conditions, suitable for all climates and geographical areas in the United States. While the designs were easy for local builders and contractors to follow, the lack of an architect in the construction process did affect the design quality of the completed building, and often resulted in small post offices that were a-contextual and stylistically homogeneous (emphasizing economy over creativity). There was notably no emphasis on landscaping. The topic is explored in the "USPS Nationwide Historic Context Study: Postal Facilities Constructed or Occupied Between 1940 and 1971" (URS Group, Inc. prepared for U.S. Postal Service, September 2012.).'),

Featured on the 12th Annual Radcliffe Scholarship Benefit House Tour in May 1960. Roger G. Kennedy (1926-2011) lived an extremely interesting, notable, and arguably charmed life: His family ran Kennedy Brothers Arms Co. for several generations, a gun shop and expedition outfitter. After serving in the Navy during WW2, he graduated from Yale in 1949 and returned to graduate from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1952; the year unsuccessfully ran against then-DFL Congressman (later Senator) Eugene McCarthy. He then became Washington correspondent for NBC in the 1950s, with a radio program and doing news on the Today Show. He returned to his hometown of St. Paul, where (at the time this house was built) he was Vice President of the Northwestern National Bank of St. Paul (where he worked from 1959-68). As a successful young executive, the St. Paul Jaycees as "Outstanding Young Man of 1962" for being the youngest member of the executive committee of the Metropolitan Improvements Committee, alongside serving as chairman of the board of directors of the Guthrie Theater, President of the Minnesota Arts Council, Chairman of the United Arts and Science Fund drive, member of the board of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Minnesota Orchestral Association, the St. Paul Civic Opera, and the St. Paul Community Workshop. He was also an author, in 1969, after the publication of one of his books on history, The Minneapolis Star book review described him as "the Twin Cities banker-lawyer-government advisor-TV producer [with] enthusiasm for finance and banks, architecture and local history." He became a passionate historian of Minnesota architecture. In 1979, he was hired to lead The Smithsonian\'s "Museum of History and Technology," which he transformed into the National Museum of American History; he had no experience in museum administration, but led that museum into what was considered its "golden age" as he collecting beloved pop culture items while also focusing on minorities and untold stories, such as the Great Migration and Internment of Japanese Americans. He then led the National Park Service from 1993-97, where he wore the NPS flat hat, gray shirt and green trousers in a show of solidarity with the rank and file. While doing all of this, he was also an executive with the Ford Foundation in New York, and wrote more books, including 1982\'s "American Churches." He died of melanoma in 2011, age 85.'),

In August 1968, during construction, it received special approval from the city of Richfield for a 240,000sf, $200,000 indoor tennis building with 4 indoor courts as well as 3 on the roof; the permit was granted under a new ordinance that allowed recreational facilities on multiple-residence properties.

Designed to house Federal offices, Federal Courts, and the U.S. Post Office. Principal material is reinforced concrete in precast panels studded with exposed Colorado quartz aggregate; the 355 window units, each weighing 3.5 tons, were fabricated by Des Moines\' Mid-West Concrete Industries). The framework of the building is reinforced concrete pillars and 200 tons of structural steel, as well as 800 tons of reinforcing bar steel for the concrete. A fifth-floor machinery penthouse was also incorporated into the design of the 26-foot ceilings of the federal courthouse below. Vermont marble was used for the main lobby. A smokestack went from the top of the northeast corner and extended 25-feet below the surface to natural gas boilers in the subbasement. Original arrangement gave the ground floor to the post office, the top floor to the courts (with some support on the third floor) with federal agencies in the rest of the structure and the entirety of the 2nd floor. Budgeted at $4,400,000. Designed by Jack G. Askew; the firm began work on the June 3, 1959. For this project the typical design process was out of order: the federal government had the firm make a survey of the space needed by each federal agency and adapt its design accordingly. As Askew noted, "Customarily, government just tells you how much over-all space they want and fit the offices into that area. This time they first learned what was needed." The original design was initial envisioned by Askew as more traditional, but it was overruled "because it didn\'t look like any other federal building." Project engineers for Leonhard & Askew: Gil Leer and Bill Wharton; Builder: F.D. Rich Co. (Stamford, Conn., local rep Ed Strack); local architect Askew noted "When we heard a firm from Stamford, Connecticut, had gotten the contract we had visions of all that money going out of state, but about all they brought in were a very few supervisory people and work that couldn\'t be done locally." Replaced a previous Federal Building (1913). The idea was conceived in 1944, the Bismarck Chamber of Commerce launched a Federal Building Committee in 1952, and through political wrangling and support of the local business community landed the complex. Construction began on January 14, 1963; cornerstone laid on April 29, 1964. Mid-construction changes added a second courtroom on the 4th floor and revised office space on the second (adding room for a congressman’s offices), pushing back its opening by several weeks from the initial plan of August 15, 1964. The Post Office opened on September 8, 1964 (throughout construction, the building was referred to in the local papers as the post office). In addition to the Post Office and Federal Courts, 23 federal agencies moved in, including the Soil Conservation Service, Farmers Home Administration, Federal Crop Insurance Corp., Bureau of Public Roads, Geological Survey, Federal Wildlife Agencies, local IRS offices, local FBI offices, Selective Service, Indian Inheritance, and others. Dedicated on Wednesday, September 16, 1964. Renamed the William L. Guy Federal Building in 1999 to honor former a North Dakota Governor.

The form emphasizes the horizontal and is topped by a swept-back gable roof and brick terrace, and the angle of the windows lets in sunlight from sunrise to sunset. Following FLW\'s sensibilities, the house does not have a basement (or attic), the floors are concrete (deeply scored into rectangles) and have the same red pigment as the exterior. The southern face includes a point of mitered glass with no casing: at the point glass meets glass at an angle. To emphasize the horizontal appearance, the mortar in the brock which forms interior and exterior walls is raked deeply on the horizontal joints and flush on the verticals. The entrances are somewhat hidden.  The house uses earthen tones. Banked earth surrounds it on the west side. Low, gabled roof comes down on the east side to create an overhang for a carport…for better or worse for the climate of Bismarck, the house only has a covered carport. The interior features a large fireplace from which the remainder of the house radiates in wings. Closets are built-ins to open things up and eliminated clutter; contrasting the concrete and brick are warm Philippine mahogany plywood paneling and pumpkin-colored Formica on cabinet topis in bath and kitchen. Lights are recessed in triangular openings in the ceiling. Ralph Thompson was a very avid amateur archeologist and, with permission from the architect, 28 American Indian stone implements mortared into the brick along the north wall of the study. The Thompsons bought the lot in 1954. Unable to find a local architect, the wrote to Frank Lloyd Wright in late-1958 and the architect\'s secretary Eugene Masselink wrote back asking for the program with FLW\'s usual request for information and photos of the site. FLW died on April 9, 1959, but four days after his death the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation said they would accept the commission under the successor firm, Taliesin Associated Architects; the Thompsons agreed and it was assigned to Allen Lape Davison and John H. Howe, with overall supervisor William Wesley Peters, FLW\'s son-in-law, who was executive vice president of the Frank Lloyd Wright Institute; the overall design is mostly assigned to Davison. Two years of back and forth between client and architects finalized the design. Builder: Harold Scott.

Distinguished for its inverted hyperbolic, cast-in-place, concrete paraboloid columns, or simply the "umbrellas," with 67 of them used inside and out. The iconic columns show influence of both the "lily pad" columns of Frank Lloyd Wright\'s Johnson Wax Headquarters (1936-39) and, more recently and directly, Minoru Yamasaki\'s Northwestern National Life Building in Minneapolis (design finalized in January 1963, built 1964-65). The distinguishing differences of this structure from Yamasaki\'s are the decision to turn the columns 45-degrees. The columns form a 16-foot portico on three sides of the building. The bays formed in between are tall and rise to a half-circle on the top; within each is set a gray, insulated glass in an inverted U-shape, and within the space formed by the glass an insert echoing the geometric pattern. The implementation of glass (fitted into neoprene gaskets which in turn fit into structural aluminum sections) was similar to the approach used in automobiles and the first time such a technique was used in Bismarck. The overall structure is shorter than Yamasaki\'s so the decision to turn the columns 45-degrees makes it less squat than it otherwise may have looked. The columns continue into the interior, where they fit somewhat like the Johnson Wax columns. A floating mezzanine sets back the executive offices, company library, and lounge on the upper floor. The interior checkerboard formed by the square "umbrella" tops is filled with lighting ("simulated skylights") to illuminate work areas. Architect Jack Askew noted the design "preserves the classical while making an attempt at a modern, progressive type of building: a structure which implies the solid dignity associated with an insurance company coupled with the farsightedness of a growing, expanding company." The $475,000, 18,400sf project (including building, land, equipment, and fixtures) was built as the new home of the insurance company, popular referred to as Northern National. Exterior lighting was highlighted by 19-spherical pendant lights between umbrellas (since removed). The company announced plans to build on December 20, 1963. Ground broke in 1964, completed in August 1965; North Dakota Gov. William L. Guy cut the ribbon at its dedication on October 2, 1965. Builder: Froeschle Sons, Inc. The company was founded in January 1957 as Northern Founders Insurance Co. and grew rapidly; the company name changed before they moved into the new building. Later renamed the Manhattan Building.

Developed under the name "Civic Arena," the large multipurpose venue went through 3 special elections to fund and break ground. The exterior is sheathed in lots of Hebron brick, with curving walls on the north (main entrance) and south sides with vertical indentations breaking up the mass, and straight east and west walls that are ribbed with concrete pilasters and topped by a matching cornice. A similar design was used for the entrances projecting from the lower portion of the north and south ends of the building, with the north entrance\'s roof projected forward to provide shelter for the main entrances (these entrances have been obliterated by additions). Originally proposed in 1964, it won a special bond vote authorizing $1.8M. The architects, under the leadership of partner Robert H. Ritterbush, were brought in early to do a feasibility study of using either expanding the old World War Memorial Building or building a new venue; the city decided the better option was to build new. The plan from the beginning was an adaptable event space for all kinds of sports, shows, and other gatherings could take place. Initial plans and drawings were revealed in August 1966. The structure was initially designed with an 18-door main entrance facing Sweet Ave, with 8 ticket windows in the large main lobby; ground level was the balcony level. Unfortunately, the initial construction bids that came in were $900,000 over the proposed budget, prompting a special city election proposing a sales tax; the vote failed and attempts were then made to cut costs by leaving off certain features that could be added later and reducing the capacity. Ultimately a citizens committee favored having the structure built to its original capacity but with certain features removed such as the permanent stage, some seating unfinished, and using a concrete arena floor. The next round of bids was far below the previous budget ($1,523,468) that items were restored to the design. A last-ditch push by developer trying to change the location to his own land was defeated in a special election in June 1967, and construction began that same month. One of the losers of the final special election, businessman Harold Schafer, followed-through on a campaign pledge to support the eventual winner and gave $55,000 to pay for equipment needed to host school events such as scoreboard and backboards; soon after this gift, a dozen Bismarck businesses and professionals signed notes for $320,000 towards a $400,000 loan to purchase necessary ice, air-conditioning, and sound equipment; by January 1969 the pledges were over $510,000 (above the loan!). The budget climbed to $1,955,000. The design was handled primarily by Merlin E. Rudrud and Robert H. Ritterbush; both were interviewed by The Bismarck Tribune for a special section (8/30/1969) on the opening of the venue; Ritterbush noted "the city wanted a building which could do everything. As we worked it became more and more apparent that the money originally allotted was never going to be enough. And everybody involved wanted his particular feature included. Eventually we had to change things here and there, make the building a little smaller." It was the firm\'s first civic arena, so they researched examples in the Dakotas, Minnesota, and farther away; as Ritterbush noted, "We wanted to find out what problems other buildings have had, so we could avoid them. We studied ingress and egress, ticket facilities, management problems and many other factors." Rudrud added "The plan is part of the research, really. An Architect has to be trained to feel; he has to begin to think like the people who will use the building. Then he can add his own ideas and thoughts. The final building is a kind of translation of that inspiration, tempered by other factors." Consulting engineers: Dunham Assoc. Builder: Anderson, Guthrie & Carlson. It opened in August 1969, with its first show being "Holiday On Ice" on September 5. Additions have erased the original Sweet Ave entrance, as that block of street was absorbed for an expansion; similarly, Bowen Ave was curved around a new addition on the southern end.

The auditorium is of primarily reinforced concrete construction. The main floor originally comprised library, student lounge with an adjacent covered outside terrace (the cover also uses an accordion roof and is still extant), administrative offices, mechanical equipment, and a kitchen-dining facility designed to accommodate 150 students at once. The upper two floors comprised academic areas, with liberal arts and social sciences on the middle floor, and physical sciences on the top floor. Budgeted at $560,000. It replaced a recently constructed building on the southeast corner of the state capitol grounds in 1955; during construction of that first dedicated building, it became clear the growing needs of the college and state were going to become a source of conflict. The State bought the building for $530,000, and traded the 15-acre Capitol Campus for 34-acres next to the North Dakota State Penitentiary. In hearing about the new site, Harold Schafer (the wealthy founder of the Gold Seal Company) donated his horse ranch to the new campus. Plans were made in May 1959, contracts let in January 1960, ground broken in May 1960, and the new campus was ready in Fall 1961. The decision to move the campus to land donated by Schafer prompted the decision to relocate the planned armory to its present location just southwest of the campus so the building could double as physical education facilities for the college. The area was named Schafer Heights in June 1961 (previously Meadow Lark Hill). In 1984 the school was transferred from the Bismarck School Board to the State Board of Higher Education, with the name changing to Bismarck State College in 1987; in 2018 the ND State Board of Higher Education directed the school to become the state\'s first polytechnic institution, which it did in 2020.

Masonry exterior evokes an ancient form, the architect developed a patented structurally augmented, faced, masonry barrier for the exterior. It almost appears as a stone shingle. The structure features a large auditorium/sanctuary, with two wings coming off the east side in what the architect intended as "open arms" creating an entrance plaza. All flat roofs. The northern wing is two stories. The overall building is built into a hillside with at leave five levels. The original plan for the church ended up changed fairly substantially at the last moment due to cost overruns associated with the foundation/excavation work: including the significant decision to "flip" the plan (rotated mirror image), which also pushed off a planned grand entrance. The masonry used in construction was innovative, supported by a successful US patent application filed during the design phase and issued after construction was complete. This masonry was adapted and used again by the architect in many other projects. Its claimed advantages of “…” make clear the difficulty of modifying or retrofitting the structure. Project architect for Victor Christ-Janer & Assoc.: Do Chung; Associate architects: Sovik, Mathre & Madson (Northfield) and Joseph J. Weichselbaum (Rochester). The design of the auditorium does implement some elements of Edward Sovik\'s well-known flexible sanctuary spaces that could be used for things other than worship. Builder: Floyd Larson Construction. Congregation formed in the 1860s, this is their 4th church. Architect selected in April 1965; per the church, Christ-Janer did not impose a grand vision for the building, and his initial proposal was for 3 separate buildings that, over the process of discussion with church leaders it was modified to the form it took when excavation began. Foundation work began in May 1967 (leading to the issue with excavation); first service was held in February 1968. The dispute between architect and congregation over the site excavation costs led to a wedge between them; after attending a March 1968 meeting he had nothing more to do with the project (his office did). The additional costs caused the congregation to need to cut some features. Christ-Janer patented the masonry system he developed here: it was filed during the design process in February 1966 and issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office after construction was completed In January 1969 (US3421278A: "Structurally augmented, faced, masonry barrier"); benefits claimed: "imparting to the wall substantial rigidity, resistance to bending stresses, and increased load-supporting strength." An unsympathetic entry addition/remodel was added in 2000, which does little to try and work with the existing structure.

Included practice rooms for organ and piano students, tiered rehearsal rooms, large kilns for ceramics and sculpturing (large enough for life-size), modern staging facilities for drama, and large areas for after-event receptions and social gatherings.

It was estimated to cost $1,500,000. The current design was presented in the Argus-Leader on 03/09/1968. What had been glassy was now opaque boxy brick with architectural concrete framing, with the budget at $1.75M.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 3, 2020. Sound 80, Inc. engaged Minneapolis-based architect Douglas A. Baird (who was previously partnered with Ralph Rapson) and nationally renowned acoustical engineer Robert Hansen (NYC) to design what they wanted to be "the best damn studio" for recording artists. Landscape architect: Charles Wood Associates; Builder: ALM Construction and Engineering; Structural engineers: Meyer, Borgman & Johnson; Mechanical engineers: Mechanical Design. To save money, Baird’s initial design was reduced in scope on the exterior, preserving the focus acoustical elements based on the latest scientific standards for acoustics. As noted in the structure\'s NRHP application "concrete block walls, sound locks with sound retardant doors, and acoustical ceiling tiles deadened outside sounds, meaning that the two main music recording studios (Studios 1 and 2), which were across the hall from each other, could have concurrent recording sessions with no sound cross contamination." The total construction cost for permitted work was approximately $230,000, and the studio opened in early 1971. Initially listed at 2501 27th Ave S on some permits. Originally L-shaped, a 1995 addition to the SE gave the building its rectangular footprint. Some design work credited to Gerald E. Carlson on permits (may have been employed by ALM). '),

Between the two buildings was a large gas holder (sometimes called a gasometer or gasholder), where gas was regulated in a large container in which gas was stored near atmospheric pressure at ambient temperatures; the volume of the container follows the quantity of stored gas, with pressure coming from the weight of a movable cap (often in tandem with water-sealed design) and supported by an exposed circular metal framework.

From the beginning, the developer touted the court\'s "crystal like dome" above (January 1972); the dome sits on a larger clerestory pedestal that was described in the March 1973 reveal of the final design as a "360-degree skylight system." The octagonal central court roof is held up by eight 56ft steel-reinforced concrete columns. The central court formed a square from which the four anchor stores attached at the corners with short wings connecting them. Initially 1,100,000sf of retail area, making it the largest mall in the state at the time of completion. The saga of its development drew questions about the ecological cost of such developments, as its initial proposal in the early 1960s was consider a welcome development that would rid a swampy area of little value, only to run headlong into the burgeoning environmental movement that saw the mall as the destruction of valuable and ecologically rich wetlands. As part of the environmentalist pushback, the exterior was designed to be more "subdued" with browns and greens to better blend in the giant boxy structure, and parking lot lights that aimed downward rather than outward. The developer ignored requests for conserving land by creating a 2-story parking ramp in favor of dedicating more area to asphalt parking lots. Developed by Dayton Hudson Properties. Grading work by C.E. Coulter Surveyor & Associates, Inc. The firm began acquiring parcels for the development since 1960. Originally planned with 3-anchors, additional land acquired in 1969-70 permitted the expansion to allow 4. When first disclosed in 1963, the name was to be Oakdale, this was changed in 1967 to Twelve Oaks, before the company decided to continue the -dale naming conventions from their 3 previously developed malls: Southdale, Brookdale, and Rosedale. Current name announced in November 1971 as part of a proposed mall with 325,000sf of tenant-store area (with 4 anchor tenants) on 85-acres. The formal plans (estimated at $33M) were unveiled in January 1972, with more major stores than the company\'s previous mall developments. The originally announced anchors were Dayton\'s, Donaldsons, J.C. Penney, and Sears department stores, build around a 2-story central court of 80 to 110 smaller stores (Dayton\'s own store was planned at 3-stories). The original timeline was for construction by 1971, but uncertainty over plans for the upgrading of Hwy. 12 (now Interstate 394) delayed development. By this time the current layout of the development was close to its final design. The design for the area had some local opposition (under the banner of the Ridgedale Action Committee) for its serious alterations of local wetlands (including filling in wetlands, removing mature oak trees, flattening ridges…all ironic considering the projects various names over the development timeline), some protested in front of the company headquarters on Nicollet Mall and there were many published letters to the editors of the (then separate) Star and Tribune. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources was powerless to stop the filling of lakes and marsh wetlands because the elevation was 918 to 920 feet above sea level while the DNR at the time had jurisdiction over wetlands up to 917 feet. In an attempt to pacify the opposition, Dayton Hudson donated 45 acres east of the center (land that critics noted was undevelopable to begin with…) and agreed to delay development east of the center until 1980; it also designed a drainage system to carry runoff into a siltation basin rather than into the city\'s sewage or the surviving marshlands. The DNR "strongly urged" that Dayton Hudson not excavate or fill within 50 feet of the edge of the marsh (to no avail); it also encouraged the City of Minnetonka to enact a wetlands ordinance. Sears announced a 200,000sf store with detached automotive service area. J.C. Penney\'s announced a 159,000sf department store and 16,000sf detached auto center. 4 construction workers were hurt when steel rods meant for reinforcing one of the support columns in the central dome collapsed and knocked them off a scaffold. It\'s opening (alongside Maplewood Mall) was framed in the Minneapolis Star (07/28/1974) was summarized "viewed by some as an ecological predator, by many as a valuable economic transfusion." It\'s development was summarized as "treacherous" and further noting "Built alongside a march that abounds with wildlife, and on a leveled site that once boasted rolling areas covered with oak tree, Ridgedale provides a clear picture of how rapidly environmental attitudes have changed during the past decade." This was the final of the -Dales developed by Dayton Hudson Properties (now Target Corp.).

Received 1977 honorable mention in the commercial category of Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.\'s sixth annual energy conservation awards program. The January 1980 issue of AIA Journal included it as a primary illustration of the importance of energy-efficient design concerns in the 1970s. Received attention in the AIA Journal\'s Third Annual Review of New American Architecture (May 1980), the purpose of which was "to assemble the best recent work we can find, regardless of whether it has been published elsewhere. Some of the buildings are winners of AIA honor awards, some are not." Built on an expansive 55-acre site, the building is trapezoidal in plan. The design had an emphasis on creative approaches to energy efficiency, as described by Thomas F. Ellerbe: "In addition to open and closed office space, the structure also housed considerable computer equipment. At a time when energy had become expansive, the building was designed to be self-heating from the recovered heat of the company\'s three main-frame computers. The payback period for the heating and cooling systems was expected to be just eight to nine years. Lighting also afforded an opportunity for savings. Ellerbe installed task or desk-top lighting rather than traditional ceiling fixtures for an initial savings of $250,000 and annual savings of $38,000 in energy (in 1979 dollars and energy rates). It was the first major building designed and built specifically for the use of talk/ambient lighting. The building\'s passive solar shape was a cantilevered parallelogram, sited by computer to minimize the intense summer heat of a high Minnesota sun, while allowing those warming rays to enter when the sun was at a winter low. The structural system for the cantilevered front was an important engineering consideration. Each façade of the building was designed in response to energy values, creating a visually energetic expression of function." The firm designed interior and landscape plans, and was excited to have this building as the culmination of 70 years since its founding in 1909. Underground tanks were used to store surplus heated water and chilled water to supplement air-conditioning. The east and west exterior walls are precast, windowless walls that appear as sawtooth bookends for two very different facades: The northwest features deeply recessed windows to act as solar visors. The southeast face features floors that cantilever one over the other to shield summer sun but allow in winter sun. Bronze-tinted, mirror glass, and a solar blind over the entryway glass were also implemented for energy savings. The open office plan was to maximize air distribution, and corridors were located along the building\'s perimeter and the central atrium to offer a thermal buffer for work spaces as well as serving office flexibility.

The elegant building garnered comments from jury, calling it "a contemplative building" that "offers executives minimum interruption from the hubbub of general office procedures" and praised the architects for the 4-level step design that would\'ve permitted the use of the natural sloping grade and had offices "with only wilderness in view." Brubaker: "A logical response to a steep hillside. Not a formula office building, but an articulate, coherent design. " Vreeland: "A well-executed, \'natural\' for a hillside, more forced or cliche than the art center school [Pasadena, also awarded that year], but nevertheless extremely well done. One doesn\'t learn anything new from it as one does from a number of other winners, except that increasingly this country is turning out more competent architects, and that architects are learning very fast to do good buildings. One certainly hopes it will get built." Alas, despite those juror comments, (1) it did not get built and (2) the eventual building was indeed a formula office building. It appears, based on the juror comment (their review was in Fall 1969) and the fact the citation was for "Executive Office Building, Bloomington, Minnesota" without specifically mentioning CDC (unusual for submissions), the design may have already been rejected. Even more embarrassing, after HGA won the citation, "Control Data officials had trouble even remembering they had once considered such a building." Bruce Abrahamson quipped "I suppose you could say our design was shelved." Of note: the design is similar to what HGA eventually employed on the H.B. Fuller Company Willow Lake Conservatory in Vadnais Heights (1979-85), so perhaps it was not a total loss? But back to this glass box: By January 1970, CDC had ditched hiring local and instead went with Omaha-based HDR for a 15-story office tower (with a lot more room than the original design). The new design was later featured in a May 1970 ad in P/A by Fenestra, for its extensive use of its fenestration products: "Control Data\'s new headquarters building will reflect many images. New thin sight line FENMARK ThermoGrid Wall System plays an important role ... for it supports the nearly one-quarter million square feet of golden-hued, reflective insulating glass" boasting the "All steel system for strength and stability. Narrow sight lines. U factor of .59" (etc.). During this period, CDC was one of the foremost mainframe and supercomputer companies, competing against national powers Honeywell (also MN-based at the time), IBM (which had built a massive Eero Saarinen-designed facility in Rochester), UNIVAC (which also had many facilities in the Twin Cities), GE, NCR, DEC, and others--all the while the Twin Cities were boosted by the research emerging from the University of Minnesota. In 1972, one of their leading engineers, Seymour Cray, left to found Cray Research in the Twin Cities. For all its importance to midcentury cutting-edge computing, it was fitting that the building was honored with the cover photo of the July 1971 issue of P/A (an honor only previously bestowed on the original Guthrie Theater) as part of a major feature on "Computers and the architect." The section on the building, "The computer said\' mirrors\'", focused on how the architects-engineers HDR used computers to make design decisions, including size, curtain wall specs and space planning.To meet CDC\'s corporate image, the program to HDR stated the building must be "young, clean and dynamic" and must "relate to its surroundings, the community and to human scale" (i.e. what the HGA design achieved). To manage the 580,000sf size, the designers broke up the space into 3 volumes (one 15-stories and two 13-stories, connected at the base and via circulation core), and used reflective gold glass to give it a "clean expression" they thought would add warmth and make the building become part of its surroundings "by reflecting the landscape and further break down the scale by reflecting the towers back on each other." The building has a slipformed core (which saved an estimated 2 months of construction time), with the rest of the structure using steel beams, steel deck with lightweight concrete topping in a composite design, and steel columns. At the time, Control Data owned over 100 acres (which included their manufacturing plants) and the towers were connected to them underground. Actual cost was $15M, including design fees, site development, parking and all interior partitions. Builder: Kraus-Anderson. Renovated in 1993, and 2003; the latter changed the color of the glass façade from gold to blue. The rest of the former CDC campus has been redeveloped into mixed use, with the introduction of a light rail station in 2004.'),

The complex itself is built across two city blocks, sitting on a "pedestal" as it bridges 6th St S. Hennepin County Board selected John Carl Warnecke & Assoc. in August 1967 on the recommendation of consultants SUA, Inc. (Beverly Hills, CA); in 1966, SUA suggested in that the county build a courts and administration building as well as other structures to meet space needs; the fee for the architects was 6.75% of construction costs, with preliminary plans due by April 1, 1968 and final plans by October 1, 1968; Warnecke presented his twin towers by December 1967, and urged a prompt development of a master plan for the area around it: "It\'s amazing what one building can do to start a rejuvenation and get a Civic Center plan." As in the final construction, the east tower was proposed to hold courts, the west administrative offices; the space in between the towers was planned as the atrium with bridges crossing in between. The initial December \'67 presentation showed shorter towers (17 stories) that were expandable "by about a third in 1973 to meet projected space needs until 1990." A previous concept had the construction of just a court building in 1968, with an administrative building added in 1973. The county had envisioned the cost being around $28M, only to be given an estimate closer to $50M. The large model Warnecke present in May 1968, of two 24-story towers costing $43.9M, was essentially the design eventually built. The sheer increase in cost led to delays by political elections and whether to fund it. Warnecke proposed a parallel $180M development plan under a new "civic design district" in the 18-blocks surrounding the historic City Hall and new Hennepin County Gov\'t Center and plazas with an array of dense towers.

The wedge-shaped house forms a pronounced point on the northeast side; the triangular design was primarily determined by its site: an irregularly shaped lot with 230ft of lake frontage, that narrowed from 80ft to 19.5ft from the street. Built as part of the Partenwood neighborhood, initially laid out by John H. Howe (with several houses of his design), the covenants required a low-profiled, sloped roof structure built of "natural" materials to conform to the design of neighboring buildings. The roof rises in 3 progressive tiers, beginning the NE corner as 1.5 stories and ends at a high wall at the lake side enclosing the two-story living and bedroom areas. The high wall is shaped with straight line segments in a gently bowing form to provide a single large bay window that looks out over a deck toward the lake. The street-side (NW) blocks northwest winter winds and the street traffic. The roof, which starts low at the windward side, deflects the breezes. Major windows are to the southeast, the entrance to the southwest and small windows to the north. The major living areas are arranged around a fireplace, which the architect calls a "form designed predominantly to be the pivot point of the formal organization of the plan." Exterior is finished in 4" vertical cedar boards, stained light gray, and cedar shingles on the roof. The interior wall finish is white painted sheetrock except for the cedarboard covered fireplace. 1982 AIA Honor Awards jury consisted of Joan E. Goody (chair), Howard Barnstone, Thomas Beeby, John O. Merrill Jr., Jay C. McAmis, Robert Venturi, and Gary Chan (student); their overriding philosophy was "Spatial organization is conceived for the benefit of the user, rather than to satisfy a preconceived geometric order. Appropriate use of traditional building materials and methods has produced a variety of solutions with appealing textures and colors." This led the jury to note their "final pool" unexpectedly included a preponderance of modest and low-tech commissions. Good observed: "We had anticipated more examples of design that could represent solutions to the many large scale, socially significant or technologically difficult building problems facing us today." On the LeJeune Residence, the jury saw it as "a subtle response to a demanding site. Circulation sequences and careful placement of openings dramatize views to the lake while sheltering private spaces from road disturbances." Architect credited with design: Milo Thompson; Structural engineer: Meyer Borgman & Johnson, Inc.; Builder: Cramer-Weir Construction Co. Larry LeJeune helped turn his dad\'s steel fabrication business, LeJeune Steel, into a successful local empire.'),

Designed with a "pedestrian street" along the north and east facades and a stepped massing of library reading rooms on the south and southwest side. Received an honorable mention in the 1978 Owens-Corning Energy Conservation Awards, noting the use of terraced roof gardens to provide additional insulation (too bad they leaked and had to be removed) and reduces glass on the north and west exposures (giving the building its notorious dark cave feeling among students). The law library received a 1980 Library Building Award of Merit (sponsored by the AIA, the American Library Association and the National Book Committee).

While understated in its massing, 100 Washington Square contains nods to Yamasaki’s principles of surprise, serenity, and delight. The dark green marble interior of the first floor is delightful in its cool and graceful welcome to ground floor visitors, entering from the street or skyway. In the central elevator bank, a high arch reflects the height of the building above, and gives the effect of a monastic serenity. \n\nLocal architectural critic Andy Sturdevant notes that 100 Washington Square (opened in 1981) and the Northwestern National Life Building (opened in 1965) bookend the city of Minneapolis’ efforts to redevelop the Gateway district. 100 Washington Square sits just outside the edge of Minneapolis’ downtown that was built up further in the skyscraper boom of the 1980s.\n\nClient: Northwestern National Life Insurance Office Tower & Parking Garage; Engineer: Alfred A.

If the earlier building is a debatable bauble, its younger, much larger sibling (24-story tower costing $35 million) is a white-faced lump of a fellow, squat and square, whose first words might have been \'me first.\' The shape is a box on stilts perched on a tiny marble-and-glass lobby at its base. In form and scale it is an outsized misfit. But it is designed to be temperate in energy use, with its exterior broken only by a small grid of windows that take up less than 25 percent of the surface; parking for 400 cars is buried underground."'),

It was also one of a handful of houses featured in the seminal 1979 book "Earth Sheltered Housing Design: Guidelines, Examples, and References" by the Minnesota Energy Agency, considered a bible of earth-berm/earth-shelter house design. McGuire\'s own talent as an architect gave it a flair that rose above some of the more utilitarian designs at the time to aesthetically blend in with the environment. It was designed to appear like the house itself has become reclaimed by the landscape. Built in 1972 at the height of the energy crisis for two professors (Pat Clark and Emogene Nelson) from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls, the owners had interest in new building forms. The house presents only two arched earth-framed glass openings to the outside (with skylights on top), which McGuire intended to echo the gently rolling countryside. The architect noted it has "the advantages of a traditional sod house." It uses an arching steel culvert structural system, commonly used only for drainage ditches, made up of a pair of culverts side-by-side: one for private spaces, the other for living and common spaces; they the link between them houses laundry and mechanicals. The culverts allow a thin-shell that can more economically support the weight of earth loads than more commonly used flat roof systems made of heavy wood or concrete. The earth cover increases from a minimum of 6" at the top of the culvert. Insulation consists of two inches of polyurethane spray on the interior of the shells. Asphalt damp-proofing and bituthene and sheet plastic on the exterior provide waterproofing. After the first 6 years of use, McGuire reported the owners found it "comfortable in winter and summer (without air conditioning). There is no sign of dampness or basement effect that one could expect during humid Wisconsin summers." Engineers: Paul Bredow & Assoc.

Shaped vaguely like an ore boat; per Birkerts: "It is like a ship anchored at the mall, indicating its direction where it will depart." AIA Journal noted "Because it was desirable to house the library\'s main collection on a single floor, and that floor would be larger than the proposed building site, the architect extended the top floor over part of an adjacent plaza, which was also part of the design project. The two lower stories progressively diminish in size from the top, providing partial pedestrian shelter for the edge of the plaza and over much of the building\'s long, narrow site. The two lower floors contain the circulation desk, an adult browsing area, the children\'s collection, administration areas and public meeting rooms." The project was particularly hampered by delays, that created unexpected complications: After signing an agreement with the architect in 1968, it took over 10 years from initial design to completion (1969-1980) due to various setbacks--many economic. At the time the project began, the city planned to demolish the disused Union Depot next door, thus building\'s design took that into account; by the time the building was built, the opinion on the depot had reversed and it was restored--only to have the library project itself awkwardly into view (creating a negative public perception of the library). This conflict has led to some rumblings in favor of knocking it down and replacing it in lieu of repairing and updating it. Per the University of Michigan\'s Bentley Historical Library (where the architect\'s papers are held), the design "attests to Mr. Birkerts\' monumentality of sculptural form, innovative use of surface materials and powerful expression of metaphor in his buildings. Although progress on the project was held up intermittently by funding problems and changes in program and management, the initial concept which Mr. Birkerts envisioned in 1969 remained intact throughout the decade of design and construction. Constricted by a long, narrow site and the need to maintain a view from the adjacent, historic Depot to the Civic Center at the end of the Fifth Avenue Mall, Mr. Birkerts floated the cantilevered Library with its curved prow over a double-decker Plaza, recalling the form of a dynamic, Great Lakes ore carrier pointing westward towards the city. The structure is enclosed by 30-inch-wide steel panels finished in polyester enamel and inward-slanting windows. These diffuse light into the building through the use of a reflecting band of silver metal below, on the exterior, and sloping, white panels above, on the interior. The interior decor of the Library, with its nautical seagreen and magenta colors, was also designed by Gunnar Birkerts and Associates, as were the Fifth Avenue Mall and Plazas and the Library Plaza Improvements." Birkerts\' original pitch was to take advantage of the city\'s long, narrow shape (with many railroad tracks) and have it sit on railroad tracks and move up and down the city from time to time.
