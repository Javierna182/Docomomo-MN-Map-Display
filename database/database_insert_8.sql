It is believed to be the first time a nonprofit professional organization undertook responsibility for the design and development of a public housing project. The 168-unit townhouse complex consists of 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom apartment homes, and was financed under the federal Housing & Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 program, all profits from the venture were to be put back into the development. The design by Close Associates to "integrate the townhouse units into the natural environment while at the same time providing a general sense of community for the residents." Each section was designed with a ground-level unit (accessible to disabled persons) and two split-level units on the top two floors. The 10-acre site included several recreational and play areas that are visible from the windows of the living units. All parking areas are to be landscaped. Builder: McGough Construction, Inc. Developed as part of the master plan for the area known as The Preserve, a 1200-acre planned community owned jointly by the Minnesota Gas Co. and engineering firm Carter & Gentz, Inc. Noted in the March 1977 issue of the AIA Journal. Co-sponsored by the Greater Minneapolis Metropolitan Housing Corporation (founded by the Minneapolis business community to stimulate production of affordable housing). The Minnesota Society of Architects announced plans to undertake the project in 1969, it took a few years to identify a suitable location; after The Preserve was selected in Spring 1972, it was further delayed by the process of obtaining federal funds. When first announced in 1972, the cost was projected at $3M, but by groundbreaking in 1976 the cost was estimated at $4,333,000. Windslope and Briarhill Apartments (7021 Woodland Dr) were the first affordable housing projects in Eden Prairie, and part of an experiment in moving subsidized housing for families out of the central city and into the suburbs as Minnesota became a leader nationwide in pushing suburban communities to take on the projects; the idea was to give children in those complexes positive role models and let them grow up in cities with lower crime rates and have access to some of the better schools in the state (by the late-1970s, the Metropolitan Council had a policy that no more than 60% of all new subsidized family housing could be built within Minneapolis and St. Paul). In an ugly moment of NIMBYism, while under construction, 10 nearby residents filed complaints with the city of Eden Prairie that the (long-approved) project was too tall, too dense, and the white/yellow/green siding did not blend into the surrounding. On what The Minneapolis Star noted were novel grounds, the City of Eden Prairie sued the all the developers and The Preserve itself in August 1977, claiming the changes in design between 1972-77 no longer met the "high-quality design" with balconies, raw wood siding, expensive landscaping and "warm earth tones" on the exterior that would blend with the character of The Preserve as a whole. The city claimed the intent to use Masonite siding with baked-on white and green finishes were only discovered by them after construction began. The Minnesota Chapter of the AIA counterclaimed against the city for $10,000, saying the suit was "groundless and frivolous" and claiming they had completely and accurately disclosed to the city what exterior finish would be before the city granted it building permits. The city\'s lawyer claimed the City Council never approved what the building permits department granted. To prevent the very unclear suit from proceeding, Windslope\'s developers offered to landscape the property with additional trees to obscure the view of the project by those 10 residents if the city would drop the lawsuit. The 10 NIMBYs agreed approving the proposal, and the city dropped the suit in December 1977. By a 1989 article assessing the Windslope and Briarhill complexes, they had met with some positive success, though the residents felt somewhat ostracized. By 2020 the project was renamed Prairie Meadows.'),

Celebrated renovation and reimagining of the massive 1906 Butler Brothers Co. office & warehouse building, which P/A pronounced the nation\'s "first major recycled building." The structure was originally designed by Harry Wild Jones as a distribution center, showroom and warehouse for a Chicago-based mail-order firm; the company launched the Ben Franklin store chain in 1927, and the building supported those stores until its location became no longer practical for its purposes. It sat abandoned for a decade, during which time it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Washington DC-based developer Charles B. Coyer purchased the building in 1972, and based on his previous experience developing Georgetown\'s Canal Square (1971), planned a renovation of the 500,000sf warehouse into retail and offices in the eastern half, and a luxury hotel in the western half. The initial phase remodeled the eastern half into a 9-story office-retail complex: the striking change was the addition of a large, central skylit court, allowing natural light into the building--several structural bays were removed from the center to reduce the total floor area and increase the amount of light reaching glass-walled interior-facing offices. The columns and beams removed for the atrium were reused for other details in the new construction. The original brick and wood were sandblasted and left exposed. A new raised floor was laid on steel joists above the old floor to allow for mechanical, electrical, and telecom. The exterior was left mostly untouched, the original rows of recessed windows were re-designed to form vertical bands of glazing. Noted in the July 1974 issue of P/A. The 1976 AIA Honor Award included the Bartlett award, which honors buildings that show a conscious effort to eliminate barriers to the handicapped; the AIA split the jury into two groups, one for new construction and one for "extended use category" as they gave 10 Honor Awards (6 new, 4 old buildings given new uses). The Extended Use jury was Jean Paul Carlhian, FAIA; Giorgio Cavaglieri, FAIA; J. Everette Fauber, FAIA; John Graves; and Ralph Youngren, FAIA; they commented "Without altering in any degree the skeletal structures, the designer has returned this impressive, mill-type structure to work on an interesting and totally realistic purpose." During the years the building was touted in various publications, the architectural firm was also called Miller, Melby & Hanson and later Miller, Hanson, Westerbeck, Bell; principal architect: John Miller; project architect: Arvid EIness (who later moved his own offices into the building and handled the second phase); Structural engineer: Frank Horner; Mechanical engineers: HVAC Temperature Engineering Corp; Builder: Knutson Const. Co. The original plan for the west half was conversion into an anchor hotel, but it did not occur. Honeywell CEO and downtown theater booster James H. Binger purchased the building in 1979 and by 1981 developed the west half into more offices (170,000sf of Class A) around a second atrium; deemed Butler Square West (designed by Arvid Elness Architects), the second atrium used more heavy timber column and beam construction (some in ruin form left in place to give the atrium more depth and drama), the second phase also installed a more efficient mechanical systems which reduced the energy consumption of the building by 70%. Noted industrial designer George Nelson, in a July 1981 piece in the AIA Journal on interior design of large structures, called it a "monster with an extraordinary internal cage of giant timbers and massive cast iron connectors, is probably alone in its class, a landmark of superlative quality if there ever was one."

It consists of several shopping arcades and a separate \'public park\' perched high and out of the way of other activities. It provides a nice retreat from inclement weather, but fails to produce a sense of centrality. In the IDS you know you are in downtown Minneapolis.

The structure has the corporate-style church design that was briefly popular at this time; the church and parish center were ready by May 1977. This was intended as a church to be built in phases, thus the award applications referred to it as Parish Center. The low total budget ($750k with furnishings) led the architects to employ ordinary and economical materials and building systems. The initial design included a worship space to sit 650, meditational chapel, baptistry, sacristy, commons/lounge space, educational space to seat 300 but subdividable into three spaces to seat 100 each, kitchen, and nursery; the design was planned to include future additions for offices, chapel for 125, library, and residential facilities for two priests. In an application for a 1981 national AIA award (unsuccessful), the architects noted "A framework of designs goals was developed early, in meetings with the Building Committee and the Liturgical Arts Consultant. We wished to enhance and dramatize a sense of community participation in the liturgy of worship. Visual emphasis would be focused on the people of the parish, on their form, movement, and interaction. Opportunities and spaces would be provided for community social contact. The visual potential of the site, as a natural setting, for natural vistas, and as a landmark were to be exploited. The sculptural character of the natural landscape would be preserved." Considerations were made from the outset as to energy efficiency, especially relying on skylights, as well as accessibility by keeping the building sited and organized on a single floor level. The goal of increasing participation and involvement in the liturgy was from the liturgical reforms of Vatican II; it was also intended as a space that could be used for non-liturgical uses such as dramatic performances or concerts. In describing the solution in 1978, the architects noted "The plan is organized with primary entrance and commons at the center. The skylit baptistry is visible to the entrance and commons and signals the approach into the church and chapels. The sacristy is located to facilitate ease of encounter between priest and parish before and after the mass.  The commons and social facilities are arranged to encourage social encounter among members of the parish. Principal public spaces are washed with daylight from skylights which are located to lend emphasis to the liturgical centers and to the presence of people. The church has provisions for performance and use of audio visual media. The spaces and forms are white to contrast the form in its natural landscape and to contrast the color and activities of the people. The natural landscape was disturbed as little as possible and final grades were established with berms and blends to maintain the rolling character. Vegetation was restored by the seeding of natural grasses characteristic of the area. The structure is of insulated concrete block cavity-wall bearing walls, steel joists, metal deck with suspended drywall 1 hr. ceilings in service areas and nursery, and exposed wood deck in the primary spaces. The 1978 AIA MN jury comprised Lo-Yi Chan, FAIA (NYC), Barton Meyers (Toronto), and Anthony Lumsen (Los Angeles); Chan commented "The interior view typifies the entire design. The introduction of natural light is central to its organization. The design represents very fastidious choices, awareness of good materials and appropriate colors. Concrete block walls are used for their pattern. We were somewhat disappointed in the design of the altar. Most of the altar elements were very well designed. However, the altar itself does not present the image that we would like to have seen. This project approximates a stereotype. It is what we would expect from a North European architect and we think it\'s a completely well ordered design. It is obviously a low budget project and what impressed us is that although there were inexpensive materials consistently used throughout, the project does come off as being very elegant."

The $2.3M medium-density, 89-unit housing development was unique for the Twin Cities area at the time, as it took a cluster-housing approach (high density with characteristics of single-family homes) to take up most of a city block; the architects opted to provide as many unit types as possible around a module based on a 12\' x 12\' bay, "dictated by the core module, containing either kitchen and stair or bath and stair. Other modules surround the core, forming many different configurations. Units are clustered to produce neighborhood pedestrian streets serving four to eight units each, and giving a sense of territorial interest to residents." The site plan implements decentralized parking and a major central space. Firm designer Tim Geisler noted the aim was to give each resident a "sense of territory" by eschewing a row of townhouses with common walls for "more random organization that will allow different views." Community facilities are in a precast concrete structure one-half level below grade. The complex is wood frame construction; it originally featured plywood siding (now an intentional mix of composite siding) and enameled metal roofs (mix of flat and shed rooflines). The 1975 P/A jury, consisting of Paul Rudolph (chairman), Peter Chermayeff, Peter Eisenman, and Eberhard H. Zeidler, were impressed by how the development "stresses variety together with a sense of community and territoriality." Rudolph: "This is quite human in its relationship of solids to voids." Eisenman: "On all sides except where the houses face the large parking lot, there is a good relationship." Rudolph: "One thing that he did, I think is quite good. In most of the parking areas, he avoided double parking spaces. He made only one row of parking to keep, to a degree, a sense of enclosure from the street. That then meant piling a great many cars on the one side." Chermayeff: "Overall, as a plan, it has a very nice characteristic: proximity of the car without parking lots becoming too strong and dominant. It has a nice penetration of pedestrian ways and public space in the center. That\'s humane scale using a modular, disciplined set of components. A very appealing direction for urban housing." Architects: Lorenzo D. Williams, president; James W. O\'Brien, director of design; James W. Geisler, designer; Timothy R. McCoy, designer. Builder: Gough Construction Co. The project, begun by the Minneapolis Housing & Redevelopment Authority (HRA) in 1972, ran into some early hiccups after the HRA initially chose to award the project to a private developer over the community non-profit recommended by the Model Cities Planning Council. Model Cities recommended to the HRA in March 1974 that the Findley Place Housing Corporation (with Williams/O\'Brien) develop the housing complex, only to see the HRA vote 4-3 the following May to deliver it to R.J. Bosclair & Assoc. for an apartment/townhouse project with less emphasis on low- and middle-income housing (the HRA weighed 7 proposals, only one by a nonprofit). The Model Cities chair threatened to file an administrative complaint to the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) asserting the HRA violated its own Neighborhood Development Program contract with HUD; HRA staff had noted that its own urban renewal plan required the authority to prioritize proposals from resident-owned or sponsored groups if more than one proposal met development objectives (staff held both proposals "were very nearly equal"). In early-July 1974 the HRA\'s own attorney said the board acted improperly and the HRA soon relented (much to the consternation of Board Chairman Robert Whitlock) and awarded the project to the resident-controlled nonprofit. It was refined down from 98-units to 89-units (79 2-bedroom and 10 1-bedroom townhouses) by economic factors, including difficulty in obtaining financing for market-rate housing and the need to obtain federal guarantees. There was some neighborhood opposition to having subsidized housing, especially from the elderly residents of the adjacent, public Charles Horn Towers; the complaints of a "ghetto of the poor" had an undercurrent of racial animosity from the mostly white residents of the senior housing complex. It also faced opposition from the business group of the Greater Lake Street Council, which feared the stigma of "low-income housing next to a shopping center." The development was always intended to tie-in with a planned Nicollet-Lake shopping center plan, a plan which resulted in the disastrous strip mall anchored by a K-Mart blocking Nicollet Ave. Final approvals were made in December 1975. Renovated in 2001; later renamed Albright Townhomes.'),

Featured in a February 24, 1979 Associate Press article (published in the Minneapolis Tribune) about earth housing, described then as a "$75,000 retirement home with a million-dollar view through French windows of the St. Croix River." To take advantage of the view, the only exposed elevation faces west; the rest of the plan was simplified to maximize the earth cover around the house and make it more cost-effective. The house was originally designed as a 2-bedroom, 1,500sf space with heat coming entirely from a wood stove in a living room hearth (they bought the smallest furnace available, but found it wasn\'t needed). Roof covered with 18-inches of dirt. The garage and above-grade entry were designed as an identifiable point of entry, as well as intended to support a solar collector system oriented to the south. The main structure was poured concrete walls with a precast concrete plank roof. Unlike many other earth-shelter houses being built at that time, the floor is wood frame over a crawl space rather than a concrete slab on grade—this was done to allow a positively pressurized plenum for delivery of heat. The design also used thermal breaks to isolate the interior concrete structure from the exterior concrete retaining walls and overhangs, placing 2" of Styrofoam in between. The house has had a small addition added to the front, as visible in a 2021 real estate listing. '),

A new school on the same site was estimated to cost $12.5M-$13.5M, a second option to build around the existing school was estimated to cost between $11M-$12M (favored by the district superintendent), the third option was to remodel the old building and build 2 new buildings on the site; in the end the the school district wanted to retain as much of the original structure as possible as a cost-saving consideration; faced with meeting the cost-saving goals of the District as well as to retrofit the building to meet 1970s standards and education requirements (including fire safety and energy efficiency), Ellerbe\'s structural, mechanical, and electrical engineers recommended gutting the building, leaving intact what original blueprints showed as a steel frame. However, in February 1975 it was learned the frame was actually done in concrete as a cost-saving alteration in 1910--however the frame was determined strong enough and construction proceeded; another factor in the program was the community demand to keep the school running at the existing location, during construction, to avoid extra disruption and cost (this, plus a fire during construction, caused delays); the original "castle" exterior was replaced with a new white concrete exterior, and adding substantial additions; the result was not without controversy: Twin Cities architecture critic Larry Millet was not a fan of the update, in 1979 he called it "The nadir of modern school architecture in Saint Paul, a building so resolutely grim and uninviting that it suggests that education can only be viewed as a form of incarceration."

Featured in the April 1980 issue of Progressive Architecture (then the biggest magazine on modernism) for its use of earth-berms on 3 sides to reduce heating and cooling needs. The sheer scale of the project made it an item of interest in studies of energy-efficient projects in many areas of urban planning. Designed as the state\'s most secure prison on a hilltop site, it was built with reinforced concrete frame, flat slab, 30ft deep retaining wall; face brick, over 8" poured-concrete back-up. Burying the building and exposing only one elevation allowed for a projected reduction in btu consumption by ~20%. The arrangement breaks the housing into seven 52-person units, all facing an outdoor rec area (each unit has its own sub-section of the rec yard); prison cells are staggered along the exposed wall so narrow, vertical windows allow in light; the buildings are 3-stories each, with cells on the first two levels and educational/administrative designed to be on top. Circulation is continuous on the top level while residential units are segmented for security. The core building, at the western corner, is the only visible building on approaching the site. Originally slated for $21.6M, it quickly ballooned to over $31.5M by 1979, unsurprisingly this caused some controversy over prison spending. Review of the cost-overruns attributed to design error and changes (often caused by the state officials) and unanticipated increases in the inflation rate; still, it helped prompt an investigation by the office of the Legislative Auditor to focus on the state\'s inefficiency in building projects.

The fall of the land is utilized in a commendable application in resolving the difficulties in the design of the four-story building. Care was exercised in the retention of the landscape. A consistent use of materials achieves a strong continuity which ties the complex together." Builder: MJM Company. The 73-unit, low-income residential complex was part of the redevelopment of the historic, predominantly black Rondo Community that was physically ripped apart by the construction of Interstate 94. The original design used soothing vertical wood siding to blend harmoniously into the environment and sunken, terraced gardens and playgrounds to offer respite from the freeway noise. Alas, it suffered from major financial mismanagement. By 1974 the federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) had taken over the mortgage, and by 1981 had foreclosed on the complex, which was described as "blighted and socially chaotic." The HUD foreclosure placed it on the open market, where it was purchased for $744,000 by a real estate group led by neighborhood developer and activist Nick Davis (who later took the name Nathaniel Abdul Khaliq), the grandson of some of the last residents forced from their homes during freeway construction who later became president of the St. Paul NAACP.

The owners\' program by the request "wanted privacy-within and without-and stressed their desire for a house that was spatially exciting and individualistic." Larson created privacy by zoning the house and augmenting it with various level changes, small niches, and a knee wall in the living room. Architectural Record thought, at the time, that a mud room at the entrance was "unusual" but felt it was also a "practical necessity for climate control." The home was also designed with a private sun-bathing platform on the roof. To account for the climate, the house had double thickness of glass fiber batts insulation. The house was wood frame construction, sheathed in plywood, on a concrete block foundation, with wall and roof surfaces originally finished in red cedar shingle. In describing the design, Architectural Record called it "Rugged and angular in character" and noted "The unexpected complication of shapes give the plan a somewhat willful character, but the spaces seem to work well and flow together convincingly. The broken planes and angular development of the elevations aptly reflect the irregular interior volumes. The interesting assortment of roof vents, stove pipes, downspouts, rain leaders and whip antenna gives the house a pleasantly unedited appearance and suggests that architect and owners share a happy unconcern for self-conscious design as well as a firm grasp of the exigencies of building and function."

The 2,200sf house was subject of a feature in the Minneapolis Tribune (01/07/1979) as it was the first of the winners to break ground. The client, University of Minnesota science-methods professor Alan Humphreys, wanted to implement many energy-efficient concepts, and opted for what he described as a "hybrid" energy system using of active- and passive-solar collection and storage capacity. Knowing his own limits, Humphreys hired Plautz to do all the architectural design and development of construction specifications. The most striking physical design was the southern (street) facade, designed as a large passive solar acquisition system, using greenhouse design that was 8ft deep and 16ft high, with half the height below grade. The bottom level was designed below-grade; the house used fiberglas batts insulation a foot deep to give it a R-40 value; substantial concrete walls were used as heat sinks; the garage on the north side of the house was built atop 2 double-loop trenches, 8ft deep, filled with cobble-size rock (as a back-up heat collector); the garage roof was designed with active solar-collector plates on top.

Won 1978 prize from the Minnesota Energy Agency for designing an energy-efficient home under $55,000; construction between spring/fall 1979 and featured on tours demonstrating its energy-efficient aspects. Honorable Mention in the 1983 Gas/Passive Solar Design Competition sponsored by the American Gas Association and Solar Age Magazine. To create top efficiency, the living areas in the 1550sf house were arranged on the south side on 2 levels with a split-level foyer entry: the upper level, half-story above ground, included living, dining, and kitchen areas; the lower level, partially buried, featured 3 bedrooms and mechanicals. Exterior designed with bleached redwood siding with white trim, is shaped to maximize solar gain and allow natural ventilation in summer; a pair of roof overhangs on the south face also shade the home in summer. A north-facing shed roof was designed to repel winter wind while the southern roof widens out to catch the sun; a short wall between the two sections of roof includes the vents to allow hot air to escape in summer (supported by a furnace blower when needed). Landscaping, featuring maple trees, planned to create additional shade in summer. Partially heated by south-facing windows and; masonry walls on the north, east, and west (insulated by 2" foam board on the exterior) store excess heat and keep the house from heating and cooling too fast. The house includes a collector system that adds lights and heat in the winter through windows in the roof and offers ventilation through those windows and low windows in walls. The roof windows are covered with insulating material at night, a system that an energy technical analyst at the Minnesota Energy Agency likened to "turning windows on and off." The shutters over the skylights implemented an automatic system that would only open when the sun was shining: silver-colored shutters were controlled by a freon-filled cannister at the top of the shutters; when the sun warmed the freon, it would vaporize and condense inside a cooler canister—causing the weight to redistribute and the shades to open (with a manual pulley for summer). Owner/Builder/Architect was only a few years out of architecture school when he designed the house, and worked at Wold for his career. '),

Post Office',E'Unknown',E'1971-72',E'Larger end of the "Thousand Series" Post Offices building boom: the series was part of the major shift in how the U.S. Postal Service operated in the post-War era: To expand quickly, the Post Office pushed a $1.5 billion privately financed lease-purchase program with local developers. Design brochures developed by the Post Office Department in the late 1950s and early 1960s guided the contract-built "Thousand Series" small post offices around the country (the name refers to building size: 1,000-12,000 sf). After sites were determined, the lease-purchase program would select developers through a competitive bid process based on the lowest bid. Bidders would choose designs from the U.S Postal Service\'s 1959 "Building Design" brochure, which stressed modernity and convenience over regional identity or the role of the federal government in everyday life. The resulting buildings were usually not designed by architects, but by the construction contractor using the brochure renderings and guidelines for reference. The brochure offered "acceptable" designs, with Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield asserting his desire that post offices be built as Modern buildings focusing on efficiency and clean lines. The International Style was predominant, calling mostly for flat roofs, exterior wall materials of aluminum or stainless-steel framed window walls with stone, face brick, or precast concrete. The brochures noted that the designs were adaptable to many variations and site characteristics, and because exterior design and materials could be adjusted to suit local conditions, suitable for all climates and geographical areas in the United States. While the designs were easy for local builders and contractors to follow, the lack of an architect in the construction process did affect the design quality of the completed building, and often resulted in small post offices that were a-contextual and stylistically homogeneous (emphasizing economy over creativity). There was notably no emphasis on landscaping. The topic is explored in the "USPS Nationwide Historic Context Study: Postal Facilities Constructed or Occupied Between 1940 and 1971" (URS Group, Inc. prepared for U.S. Postal Service, September 2012.). Owner/Builder Fred O. Watson, Co. agreed to lease it back to the USPS for 20 years with renewal options running through 30 years for the 12,000sf structure (initial rent: $49,900 per year).'),

The project did not make money for the developer, builder, or architect; Metram Properties Co., which financed the project, lost several hundred thousand dollars, but its president blamed the unexpected downturn after it began work in 1970 (adding interest costs, as well as construction costs due to inflation). Myers & Bennet won an award from Design & Environment magazine for the project\'s design. Builder: Clayton L. Miller. Original base price (1971) was $24,900 per unit (47 sold that year); by 1975 it was $29,500. The project originally faced concerns in the Field-Regina Neighborhood, then split evenly between middle class black and white residents; the density was then reduced; by a feature in the 06/15/1975 issue of the Minneapolis Tribune, the dissent was "gone" and the project was called a "terrific asset." The project still fit 112-units in an area that would’ve contained a maximum of 44 single-family houses if developed in a convention manner. Architect David Bennett noted "Our strategy for building townhouses in the area was to infuse a new white, middle-class population in the neighborhood by offering a different lifestyle from the whites who were moving out. Middle-class blacks in the neighborhood were afraid that we were going to attract poor blacks. What happened was that, since this was not designed for low-income people, the poor blacks couldn\'t afford it and the middle-class blacks were too conservative to buy in, preferring single-family homes to townhouses. What we attracted then was middle-income whites who had no prejudices about a racially integrated neighborhood."'),

The original design uses mostly brick on the exterior, in a ribbed series of thin pilasters sandwiched between unbroken bands of classic running bond on the classroom wings. Between the pilasters are recessed brick or narrow windows for classes and offices; the athletic sections on the west side are windowless, with the pilasters staying at the same height for the gymnasium and rather just extending the upper band of brick to the full height of the wall. On the eastern side the taller classroom sections do allow the pilasters to extend to the same proportional distance from the roof, with the windows following suit. The entry is a glass wall with doors, pane glass, with transom windows above the doors. Near the main entrance are 100 lockers down a hallway and 600 cluster lockers near the main entrance; all lockers were in an area sunken three steps down below the main floor so administrators could easily get a view and supervise the area while also providing steps that students could sit on to socialize or read. The combination main entrance and commons area allowed students to use lockers while attending school events without needing to open the entire building. The interior design focused on colorfulness and spaciousness. The academic wing was designed with 20 classrooms and 36 teaching stations. A gymnasium in the northwest corner was designed to seat 1,200 with pull-out bleachers, with food service and music areas to the east of it. The administrative areas are south of the gym and separated from an auditorium by the cluster lockers. A media center was placed south of the administration area in the southwestern corner of the building. Classrooms filled the south-central portion of the school, with art, home economics, and industrial arts on the east. Designed with a capacity for 1,200 students, while expecting half that number when it opened. The approach to the school was described thusly in the 08/28/1975 issue of The Bismarck Tribune: "Century High School is a victim of its environment. As you approach Bismarck\'s new high school building it appears to be a low-slung sprawling monsters sitting isolated in Bismarck\'s extreme north end – a cold picture at best. But as you near the building it becomes less forbidding, and the inside is colorful and inviting – and attempt to take the drudgery out of school attendance." The budget for the structure was $3.4M.

A plaza sits between it and adjacent Liberty Memorial Building. The building was sited to minimize the removal of mature trees on the site. The three-tiered center structure diagonally connecting the two main forms at their corners was intended as a public area with a broad expanse of windows on each level viewing the Capitol and its grounds. The exterior is faced in buff-colored Indiana limestone from the same quarry that supplied the facing of the State Capitol building; with the same limestone used on the walls of the main lobby area as well as auditorium. The main walkway to the center from the northwest leads to a granite-paved plaza enclosed on the northwest by a retaining wall. The same granite extends into the building to form the floor of the main lobby.

In 1973, The Bismarck Tribune described this project as a "personal project" of Gov. William L. Guy. As early as 1963 he proposed housing one in the old Highway Department Building (originally built as the Bismarck Junior College). In 1966 a sketch of the proposed future development of the State Capitol Grounds showed a modest addition on the north side of the Liberty Memorial Building to house a "Heritage Center." In January 1971, then-Gov. Guy called for the construction of a heritage center in time for the 1976 American Bicentennial Celebration in his state of the state address, noting that such a dedicated building had been under study for nearly a decade; a bill based on his proposal passed the state senate but failed in the house. In January 1973, then-Gov. Arthur Link tried to keep the plan going with a proposed $1M appropriation to get started on what was envisioned as a $3.5M-$4M project; at this point a location behind the Liberty Memorial Building was identified in a site sketch, though the placeholder building was more along the lines of a standard mid-century office building of several stories; a Heritage Commission, consisting of former governors Guy, John E. Davis, and Norman Brunsdale, along with the State Historical Society established a non-profit North Dakota Heritage Center Foundation. Fundraising continued for several years. Architects\' drawings were first unveiled in January 1978 for an estimated $9M center. The bids came in low, allowing an optional auditorium to be included in construction.

Design attributed specifically to architect William H. Hennemuth, AIA; this was an unusual move for the Rieke-Carroll-Muller Associates (RCM) firm which, since its 1955 origins, did work as consulting engineers, civil engineers, and projects like water plants. When interviewed for a 1982 piece in The Bismarck Tribune (whose author was not charitable towards modernism), Hennemuth noted the design approach for the bank was "one that is symbolic with the institutional function of being an office building. The overall impact was to give separate identity for the bank floor with a focal point on the (southwest) corner of the building, and (to) relate it to the downtown landscaping." Stylistically, the design was influenced by New Brutalism, found in the rough surface treatment of the bank\'s walls, as well as Moderne, with the vertical emphasis by stacking windows. Hennemuth stated those elements were incorporated for eclectic purposes, "I’m not sure if there is a neat slot to categorize everything. I didn\'t have a particular style in mind.

The main public banking area was designed to be on the second floor, with the entrance facing the garage on the north; the ground level housed the vault, safe deposit boxes, bookkeeping, proof and auditing departments; the third floor had executive offices, commercial loan, estate, and trust departments. The upper two levels were designed around a double-height space with interior balconies on the upper level: massive wood paneling on the balcony level was noted admiringly in The Bismarck Tribune upon its January 1979 opening. Design attributed to principal Don Barsness, who stated in 1982 interview with The Bismarck Tribune that the philosophical approach of the program was a financial institution is a leader in the community, and the client was the first bank to be chartered in Bismarck: "It led us to use monolithic, liquid structure that basically is a very strong statement and concept from the standpoint of solidity of the bank… It projects this philosophy."

In his August 1977 presentation to City Commissioners, Architect Beattie described the design as trying to have "a kind of warm orangy-gold look to it." Three-times the size of the previous police headquarters, staff found the design more efficient and hospitable, especially police department as their staff had referred to their old quarters as a "dungeon." The wordy name for the building was abbreviated as CLEC. Builder: Lunn Const. Co. Development was a decade-long saga: The idea of a combined city-county law enforcement center was first explored in 1969, but kept running into setbacks, due to questions of final authority (law enforcement politics between agencies) but mostly due to funding questions: A proposal was made in 1971 and denied state funding in 1973, then for federal funding in 1975. During the planning process, then-Sheriff Bob Harvey tried to keep the location close to the Burleigh County Courthouse by drawing his own plan for a combined law enforcement center on the northeast corner of the courthouse\'s block; however, planning experts said it would be unfeasible. Frustrated with lack of progress, the Bismarck PD began negotiating with the Park District to purchase land at the southwest corner of E Century Ave & N 4th St for a northside police headquarters. Another alternative that gained some steam was altering the Burleigh County Courthouse to only handle law enforcement and court business, moving all other city and county offices elsewhere. The piece of land ultimately selected was being used as a free parking lot for the Kirkwood Plaza Shopping Center and deeded to the city by the developers for free; it began to become the favored location by June 1977. By August the state highway patrol voiced interest in becoming part of the project. In September 1977, the U.S. Economic Development Administration recommended $1,914,000 in federal funding for the project, which was approved that month. Ground was broken in December 1977. One minor hiccup during construction as the discovery that part of the site had been an old city dump (missed during soil testing), requiring remediation. During construction, Sheriff Bob Harvey flip-flopped on staying committed to the project: In March 1979, he announced the Sheriff\'s Department would pull out over the lack of an adjacent jail, stating it would be impractical to potentially split his staff (at one point a 2.5-acre site immediately south of the property was considered for the jail, but fell through). After a month the sheriff switched his view. One option for the proposed jail was placing it above the planned parking garage, which architect Beattie had designed for a second-floor addition (it was never built).

The present site was selected in May 1969, with the Missouri Valley Family YMCA trustees voting to exercise a Bismarck Park Board option to purchase the land at a total cost of $70,000 (starting with 4 acres, with an option to buy 2 more in the future). After raising $745,000, the bids opened in July 1970 ended up being over $884,000 (with estimates for additional expenses to furnish and complete the building come closer to $1.2M). To try and keep the building as planned, the Y attempted a "crash" drive to raise $200,000 in two weeks to try and save a partially completed design for under $700,000. Ultimately, the building was built on a revised design with $870,000 in raised funds. The initial phase explicitly left the gymnasium, handball courts, and health club for an addition. A campaign to raise $700,000 finish the building began in 1974 and broke ground in 1975, doubling the size of the building. The additions included plans for a Teen Center, Craft Center, Meeting Rooms, Health Clubs, Activity Spaces, Handball-Racquetball Courts, Gymnasium with running track, and associated lockers and showers.

Addition to the North Dakota State Capitol." Designed as a joint venture of Foss, Engelstad & Foss (Fargo) and Ritterbush Associates (Bismarck). Major addition to create an east wing to the iconic Capitol building. The southern façade, designed to balance the existing capitol tower and legislative wing on the opposite side, was meant to emphasize the balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government. The 168,400sf project uses an Indiana limestone exterior (from the same quarry as the existing buildings) on top of a similar black granite base to match the existing capitol structures, designed to age until it appeared the same across the facades after several years; the height of the new wing was also set to the same as the legislative wing on the west side of the capitol tower. The window design is decidedly more modern, with tight grid patterns of solar shading across windows on the southern façade (screening out glare for the Supreme Court areas) and long bands of ribbon windows on the upper floors. In three- and four-story sections, it features a four-story atrium with skylights at the east side entrance with fig trees and gray terrazzo; he openings to the atrium on the upper floors featured stainless steel railings with bronze accents; the wall on the court side of the atrium was unadorned stone. The new courtroom uses a long and curving bench, upholstered lounges for spectators; the room uses ribbon African mahogany woodwork and dark wool wall coverings. Originally designed to house the State Supreme Court (on the southern end), Health and Social Service departments, a central cafeteria, and a large legislative hearing room; the state\'s Highway Patrol was also given room during construction. In the words of then-State Land Dept. Commissioner Dick Lommen (whose department was in charge of the capitol grounds): "In effect we\'re laying the tower on its side" with the 295ft north-south length (140\' width) of the new wing; by comparison, the 241\'-tall, 95\' square tower with legislative wing held 165,758sf. In describing the design, blending between old and new construction, project architect Royce A. Yeater noted "It\'s not just making it symmetrical. We felt strongly the new had to tie into the original Capitol design as well as be expressive of its own time." Total cost of the project: $11.75M. Project architects: William D. Ellig (Ritterbush); Royce A. Yeater (Foss). Landscape architects: Galpin-Poppleton Corp. Builder: Froeschle Sons Inc. Early conceptual plans included ideas for having the state\'s own bank housed inside. Attempts to develop an addition in the 1960s and earlier in the 1970s failed. Design process began in May 1977, ground broken in April 1979, move-in by December 1980 with total occupancy by October 1981. It was originally funded with money from the University and School Lands Fund, which was to be repaid under a lease arrangement from the occupying departments covering 50 years; the 1981 State Legislature then purchased the addition from the state Land Board to keep the state\'s own Highway Patrol and Supreme Court from owing rent but charging the federal government where possible (e.g. the rent for the Health Department\'s initial 26,000sf was 80% covered by federal funds). Social Service Board occupied 41,000sf. The Legislature made the move to purchase the building to absorb $1M in annual rents, funding the purchase using the lands and minerals trust fund. Some resistance to the design was lodged for not conforming to the Capitol Grounds Master Plan created in 1965 by the Barton-Aschman consulting firm; the critics called for the new wing to be connected by only a one-story section (doubling a visitors\' center) rather than attaching the existing structure across the bottom four floors and more severely affecting the appearance of the original.

The interior also included handball courts and a 25-meter swimming pool. Numerous roof collapses led to it being replaced by a $13.7 million steel roof in 2001. When it had an air-supported roof, the highest point was 115ft, 35ft higher than the 80ft walls; it was the 5th building of its kind to use a roof suspended by air pressure. Roof material construction was by Owens-Corning Fiberglass (Toledo, OH). Builder: Sharp Brothers Contracting (Kansas City, MO). The "DakotaDome" was first proposed in October 1972 as a 14,000-seat enclosed stadium. The sketch shared in May 1974 showed a large hangar-style building (like the University of Idaho\'s Kibbie Dome) that would cost $8.8M and seat 11,000 for football. The South Dakota Building Authority was formed to develop the facility and act as its legal owner, as the 1974 South Dakota legislature authorized the $7.2M project with $5.2M from the Authority with $2M in contributions. University\'s Board of Regents approved construction in May 1976, ground was broken using a team of horses and a plow on June 12, 1976. In his final letter signed as Governor of South Dakota, Richard F. Kneip suggested that the building be called the "Theodore R. Muenster Dome" to honor the USD Vice President of University Relations who he felt "more than any other person" was responsible for raising funds and pushing the legislature for the DakotaDome (Muenster politely declined, feeling others were as, if not more, worthy). At the outset, the Authority asked Fritzel, Kroeger, Griffin & Berg for their opinion as to the best manner in which an enclosed field facility could be designed, and the firm initially recommended against an air supported dome system, and ultimately, arranged for the issuance of bids on an enclosed steel structure. After bidding, it was found that the proposed closed steel structure would cost more than the available funds, so the architects then recommended a conventional field house with an open field. The Board of Regents, anxious to obtain an enclosed structure, requested that Architect hire Geiger-Berger Associates, P.C. (pioneers in air-supported structures) to do a preliminary study of an air supported roof design. Ultimately, Authority and Architect contracted for the design and building of an air supported roof system. Architect then contracted with Engineer for the design of the air supported roof system. All of this game to bear in the massive lawsuit that arose out of the 4 major roof failures that occurred in the structures first several years, apparently the direct result of the inability of the snow melt system to adequately remove the snow accumulations. In September 1978, prior to its first tear, Geiger-Berger Associates project engineer Karl Beiten stated the roof was a "perfected" version of what the company had designed for the SilverDome in Pontiac, MI, and the UNI-Dome in Cedar Falls, IA; Everett N. Quam, state engineer for South Dakota, stated in the same article that "This roof is better than anywhere in the world, and the reason is because we have learned from those other models\' mistakes." All of that hype quite literally deflated on March 3, 1979 when one of the 5,000sf triangular roof panels tore in a snowstorm, required a repair bill of $150,000. Arguments erupted between engineer David H. Geiger (who invented the style of roof), the roof manufacturer Owens-Corning Fiberglass, builders, and the Authority that ended in aforementioned court battles. The first football game was played in the stadium on Saturday, September 1, 1979 as Yankton High School defeated Vermillion High School, 38-7, before a crowd of 5,600 in a dome where temperatures rose to nearly 90-degrees. The first college football game was played a week later on September 8, 1979, with South Dakota defeating lower-division St. Thomas (MN), 22-6.'),

On the two street corners it faces, the building cuts away on the bottom three levels to form landscaped entrance plazas. Glass spandrels create the appearance of a dark-tinted base. Designed in the ad copy to be "a block-long striking architectural statement: a prestigious address…an exciting panorama of exterior courtyards and interior atriums." Developed by Stevenson & Associates, an advertising and public-relations agency run by Charles W. "Chuck" Stevenson; the firm occupied the top floor of the building from its offices in IDS Tower. Stevenson created Galaxy Limited Partnership (aka Galaxy Associates) comprising officers and directors from the ad firm.  Builder: Kraus Anderson. One of the very first projects under the recently renamed Korsunsky Krank Erickson Architects (even the initial article called them Korunsky-Krank). In 1955, Stevenson bought the agency he was working for (E.W. San & Assoc.) and changed the name several years later; at the time it had annual billings under $3M; it was peaking at $18M with annual growth of 20% per year when they opted to construct this building. Unfortunately, the advertising empire began to crumble during its construction, by 1980 its billings had dropped a precipitous 18% with similar-sized layoffs as the company lost clients. With the ad agency\'s top executives working on the building, some saw a connection—a former employee noted in The Minneapolis Star that "They started building the Galaxy building and got so involved in the project that they neglected the company. People became frustrated and disgruntled and started to leave, especially the creative people." The company was long gone by 1988, and Stevenson died in 1991 from Alzheimer\'s disease. Minneapolis Star columnist Don Morrison described it as "10 white geometric stories" (although the building is only 8 stories). The Galaxy Building got a connection to space (or at least geostationary orbit) in December 1981, when a large satellite dish (22\' diameter) was placed on the roof by Satellite Business Systems for a long-distance service.

The saga received ample coverage in the Minneapolis Tribune with discussions at the highest levels of political power, one cannot help but it due to the sheer affluence and influence of all the individuals involved. The sum total of this costly tempest in a teapot were minor cosmetic changes to the duplex to make it appear older in a neighborhood that was deemed historically value because of the varied architectural styles. The developer and architect of the project, Malcolm E. "Max" Lein (1913-2003), lived across the street; at the time he was director of the Minnesota Museum of Art in St. Paul (1947-77) and its president until 1979; Lein graduated in architecture from the University of Minnesota in \'36 and practiced for several years. The plans was for a pair of two-story, flat-roofed units with attached three-car garages (around a circular car court with large tree in the center); the design was to be finished in charcoal-gray stucco with black trim and Chinese-red accents. Neighbors reportedly descended on the construction site on March 4, 1977 and "bickered with construction crews" causing crews to leave "after the protesting neighbors stood around several oak trees on the property to keep the crews from cutting them down." The RHA president, Michael Hoffman (CEO of a packaging company) complained the buildings "which would be about 26 feet above the sidewalk line, may not fit in with the architectural character of the large, historic mansions on Summit [Ave]." The neighborhood, as part of the Historic Hill District, had been named a National Historic District on August 13, 1976, and Hoffman complained that St. Paul was still considering an ordinance that would empanel a special commission to review all construction and remodeling plans in the area (the plan violated no city building codes). Lein bought the empty lot from Lucy Fricke (both were members of the RHA) and noted "Our view is that when finished, the project will be a very handsome, elegant, contemporary complement to the entire area. Since I live across the street from it, I am personally and directly concerned about the way it looks. A great many periods are represented in the area, the whole district is an architectural conglomerate" with houses as recent as only 25 years old. The battle between the rich managed to draw in St. Paul Mayor George Latimer, who tried and failed to negotiate a settlement on the same day it erupted—however the Mayor noted the protesters were not in their legal rights to block the construction crews with picket lines. More trees were removed from the site on Saturday (3/5) as Lein said the halt would be too costly for his project; the RHA vowed to get a temporary restraining order (TRO). On Monday (3/8) the excavation began and concrete was being poured as the RNHA filed suit in Ramsey County District Court while simultaneously filing an appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court after their TRO was denied twice. On Tuesday (3/8) the RHA appeared before the St. Paul City Council, which balked when they found out that Lein had not been informed of the appearance and pushed the hearing to Thursday (3/10); that later meeting only resulted the council voting to arrange a meeting between the Mayor, RHA, and Lein. On Friday (3/11), the Minnesota Supreme Court granted the TRO and halted construction. The RHA posted a $20,000 bond to protect Lein from damages. The Minnesota Historical Society (MHS) joined the RHA in obtaining a temporary injunction on April 7th from Ramsey District court after a two-day hearing before Judge Stephen Maxwell. A settlement was reached ahead of a hearing for a permanent injunction and construction resumed on May 23rd after minor cosmetic changes were made; per the MHS attorney the changed made the duplex appear "more formal and relate better to the surrounding homes. We don\'t believe that this is the best plan for the site, but it is acceptable." The changes made the duplex\'s buildings and garages taller (to match the 3-story mansions built by the rich) via a two-foot parapet and cornice added to the top; heavier molding was planned around the windows to give them a more vertical look; a black wrought-iron fence was added to the plan on the street-side. The settlement avoided the court test of whether the state could dictate the outward appearances of buildings in the area. At the core, these buildings are still modern and are one skilled remodel away from realizing their potential, rather than the forced last-minute historic pastiche. Builder: Gilbert Hamm.'),

A mechanical engineering critique published in the February 1967 issue of P/A noted the long-term significance of the water pumps used for the building: "The decline of the water tank started about seven years ago, when Skidmore, Owings & Merrill omitted a roof tank from the General Mills Building in Minneapolis."

As a result the building, though small, shows an unusual freedom both in plan and in expression." Built into the slope of a hill and taking advantage of its position overlooking Lyman Lakes to the north of campus, the building reveals one-story of Mankato stone to the campus, and a 2-story facade of Thermopane glass and Virginia greenstone to the lake view. The new, $400,000 Fine Arts Building was intended to replace crowded and inadequate facilities in Williams Hall, one of the oldest buildings on campus. The program included workshops, exhibit areas, sculpture design, drawing and painting studios, office space, kitchenette, and a lecture hall seating 148. The plan placed the exhibition space at the center, connecting faculty offices and teaching studies in what AR described as "a deliberate reversal of the principle that a useful room should not be a traffic thoroughfare. Here professors, students and visitors are led past or through the exhibits, and the work gets far more attention than if isolated. The idea works especially well in connection with the large lecture room, which is used by other college classes than art; its doors open directly to the exhibit space, to lead other students through the exhibits. This little scheming by the designers has worked out well. In fact they got an extra dividend, in that students use the same room for lounging." It was always designed with a red door that opens to the big exhibition room of gray, light stone and natural wood. Lecture rooms and studios were painted in pastels and off-whites, to make them feel full of light; fluorescent lights and spotlights were included for special lighting where sunlight was obscured. At its opening, the Minneapolis Tribune wrote "Spectators inside had a feeling they were outside." Carleton\'s president stated it was "a building with no frills at all" and dedicated it to "man\'s search for truth and beauty. Its roots are deep, deeper than any other building on the campus. That is appropriate for man cannot live without beauty." The contemporary design was described in The Minneapolis Star (03/10/1949) as "the first of its kind on any campus in this area," as well as by firm partner Donald P. Setter. Builder: D\'Arcy Leck Const. Co. The name came from a surprise, and completely unexpected financial donation: George H. Boliou died in 1933 and unexpectedly gave $150,000 to the school—the hardware store owner, who made some wise investments after selling the store, never went to Carleton ("The records show that he didn\'t study at any other college and that he probably never went to high school"); none of his neighbors in Waltham, MN suspected he was that wealthy or that he had an interest in higher education; he died in California, and not much was made about it until a safety deposit box in Minnesota was opened in 1934. In the box they found a small fortune (especially for the county it was in), and in Boliou\'s will found the provision: "I am sincerely and deeply interested in the education and development of all deserving young men and women, free from all narrow and sectarian influences, restrictions and prejudices. I believe that Carleton college is particularly free from any such criticism. I, therefore, suggest and earnestly request that said building, which is to bear my name, shall be built and designed for some such purpose, which, in the discretion of the trustees of said Carleton college, shall best carry out this ideal." The trustees then settled on the fine arts building, and raised the additional funds to build the light stone and glass structure.

Victor Gruen, who was born in Vienna in 1903 and moved to the United States in 1941, was strongly influenced by European city life. He wanted the regional shopping mall to be a "livable" and "lovable" spaces that encouraged people to get out of their cars and interact with each other, thus filled the large central court with daylight via clerestory windows, public art, "sidewalk" cafes, and even an aviary. Some of these ideas seemed counterintuitive to what were considered American habits, for example: Before the opening, the mall could not find a tenant to lease the sidewalk cafe in the center courtyard because it was considered an "un-American" idea that wouldn\'t be popular—as a result, mall management stepped in to run it (with a caterer) so it wouldn\'t be vacant; crowds immediately jammed the café, and within 2 days a visiting restauranteur snapped up the lease before the caterer could sign it; the café remained popular in the early years. Gruen, in an extensive piece on urban planning for the July 1959 issue of Progressive Architecture (then the largest magazine on modernism), discussed his philosophy that a new urban pattern "will be salutary only if it fulfills the following conditions: 1. It must be based on the tenets of a free, democratic society. 2. It must march in step with our scientific, technological, and sociological progress. 3. It must be applicable not only to the present but to the foreseeable future. (Plans should be projected for the next fifteen to twenty years.) 4. Its aims must be realizable Without the necessity of sacrificing or destroying a large portion of the structures of our cities." Adding that "What must be changed and modified are not the individual structures but the basic pattern in which they are placed." Thus, he felt traffic should be kept from buildings as much as possible as traffic is an undesirable neighbor and buildings do nothing but feed congestion (he embraced freeways). He envisioned replacing the old, grid model of development with a "cellular or cluster arrangement" with areas of pedestrians served by transit paths that never cut through; "The size of each nucleus or cell would be governed by \'limits of walkability\'"--to that path he saw suburban, regional shopping centers as the best place to demonstrate the potential of that approach. In this case the "cell-like" organization places the mall at the center as "a cluster-type arrangement of structures serving retail, cultural, and recreational purposes around attractive, landscaped pedestrian areas; car-storage areas and terminals for public transportation directly adjoining the building cluster; multiple-lane ring roads surrounding the car-storage area. They separate service traffic effectively from private automobile traffic and bus traffic by routing service roads underground and installing all loading facilities in the basements of the buildings." Gruen first demonstrated the idea with the suburban, open-air shopping facility called Northland Mall near Detroit in 1954 (with a single anchor store for J. L. Hudson Company, which Gruen convinced of his idea in 1948; the mall wasn\'t enclosed until the 1970s). For Southdale, Gruen\'s mall nucleus was planned with cluster arrangements of a health center (he designed the medical office building, and Fairview Southdale was later added), apartments to the east of Fairview (which were realized), and office and amusement areas. Minneapolis-based Dayton\'s department store agreed to develop an enclosed mall that featured a co-anchor and rival department store, Minneapolis-based Donaldson\'s. The Dayton\'s store, originally in the NW corner, was designed by Gruen, while the Donaldson\'s, in the SE corner, was designed by Seattle-based John Graham & Co. Gruen\'s design for the Dayton\'s store followed his similar brick exterior used on the Dayton\'s Rochester (1954) and later a stand-alone in downtown St. Paul (c.1960s). True to his plan of keeping trucks away from people, a ramp leads under the building from the south to allow deliveries to be made underground. Builder: Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc. Gruen\'s vision for development around the mall was never properly realized--while the general zones for offices, residential, stores, etc. were mostly followed, he envisioned all of them grouped around large, park-like pedestrian areas that were never done. Meanwhile, adaptations of his enclosed shopping mall idea began to rapidly spread nationwide in designs he found ugly; the disillusioned Gruen later quipped "I refuse to pay alimony for those bastard developments." Despite the fact the urban plan never achieved what the planner intended; the influence of the first enclosed indoor regional shopping mall was profound: Southdale was featured in the PBS documentary "10 Buildings That Changed America." When touring the mall in November 1956, Frank Lloyd Wright had nothing but his trademark caustic wit and criticism "Who wants to sit in that desolate-looking spot? You\'ve got a garden court that has all the evils of the village street and none of its charm." Like many malls, the complex was expanded. Dayton\'s built a much larger store on the NW cap, and the original store was converted to more mall space (but the exterior walls are still evident). The space that formerly housed Donaldson\'s received a transformative remodel and does not resemble its original design.'),

As originally built, the hall represented an important milestone in a national effort to make orchestras appear less elitist and stuffy: by avoiding conservative architectural styles, while still conveying artistic beauty... then came the remodel. But let\'s take time to appreciate the original design. The cover of the February 1975 issue of Progressive Architecture (P/A, then the biggest magazine on modernism) featured the dramatic interior of the auditorium with it cube-like motif designed by noted acoustical engineer, Cyril M. Harris; it gushed "With its color, intricacy, and wit, it challenges the ingrained American image of the concert hall as a music mausoleum." It was previously noted in the October 1974 issue of P/A. The Minnesota Orchestral Association\'s program for the architects requested a concert hall and auxiliary facility which should "enhance the total concert-going experience," and "above all, the building should help achieve that most important goal--the excellence of the acoustics." The structure was designed in two distinct styles: the 2600-seat auditorium uses a two-walled design (one of load-bearing concrete and the other of structural steel and brick infill) on a windowless rectangular form with curved corners and sculpturesque brick exterior; circulation spaces run between the two walls; the administrative spaces, lobbies, and support areas were constructed of white structural steel frame with aluminum panels and reflective and bronze glass (appearance of a classic mid-century curtain wall). The auditorium is turned diagonally on a 10-degree angle to give it visual separation, while the other sections were set in parallel with the rectangular site. On the exterior were playful blue ventilation ducts. The entire auditorium was designed around acoustics, with Harris noting materials "were selected to provide optimum reverberation characteristics for symphonic music. I am a traditionalist, and believe in the use of traditional building materials in a concert hall." The hall was patterned after the acoustically superb design of the Kennedy Center (1971), "repeating almost identical dimensions of height, length, and width, the same number of tiers and almost the same number of seats." The most noted feature of the concert hall was the profusion of large plaster cubes protruding from the ceiling and back of the stage. The New York Times music critic Harold C. Schonberg noted "Psychologically this is rather startling: one keeps glancing upward, like Chicken Little, thinking that the sky is falling. But the cubes of course serve an acoustic function as sound-diffusing units." The influential critic raved about the sound in his review of the opening concert: "Tonally it is one of the most remarkable concert halls in the world." He followed it up with a piece titled "In Minneapolis, The Acoustics Are Almost Too Good to Be True." In Harris\' 2011 obituary, The New York Times noted that in Orchestra Hall "he devised a 20th-century counterpart of a 19th-century coffered ceiling by setting plaster cube-like forms into the ceiling." The February 1975 issue of P/A featured several works of NY-based Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates (HHPA) in the arts field, but the magazine\'s editorial page singled out Orchestra Hall for representing "the positive alternative" to what the magazine had come to view as "misplaced monumentality:" Though Neoclassical concert halls had given way to modern styles, the proportions remained imposing and "climaxed in the Kennedy Center in Washington, which beats them all for oppressive scale, acreage of marble, repetitive elements, and lack of humor." Noting Minneapolis\' recent spate of creative works by top architects (Rapson\'s Guthrie Theater, Philip Johnson\'s IDS Center, Gunnar Birkerts\' Federal Reserve Bank, Edward Larrabee Barnes\' Walker Arts Center, Kenzo Tange\'s MIA/MCAD), the editors felt Orchestra Hall\'s sponsors "obviously knew they would get an unorthodox building" and, fitting the result into Robert Venturi\'s manifesto Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1966), "HHPA, as expected, gave them a structure full of ironies, ambiguities, and sly references to other styles, a building that proclaims the virtues of \'messy vitality over obvious unity.\' [. . .] That is not to say that HHPA are blind followers of Venturi, or that Venturi would see their work as the embodiment of his principles. (I haven\'t asked him.)" It was the 3rd Minnesota building featured on the cover of P/A (after the original Guthrie Theater and Control Data Headquarters). Orchestra Hall was a lynchpin of a major redevelopment to connect the arts and parks in Minneapolis: M. Paul Friedberg\'s adjacent Peavey Park Plaza, an extension of Nicollet Mall extension, and Friedberg\'s Loring Greenway created a pleasant pedestrian experience from the Orchestra Hall to Loring Park, to Walker Art Center, and the now-demolished Guthrie Theater. Built on a half-block site that previously held the Lyceum Theater. The city also developed a 750-car parking garage across the street to the east (skyway connected). Construction took only 16-months. Cost of building itself: $7.5M (NYT estimated $10M on opening). Project Architects: Hammel Green & Abrahamson (project architect: Jerrald B. Olson); Associate Architects for Design: Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Assocs. (project architects: C. E. John Way and Kurt Kucsma); Structural engineers: Meyer, Borgman & Johnson, Inc.; Mechanical and electrical engineers: Michaud, Cooley, Hallberg, Erickson, Inc.; Mechanical engineering: Syska & Hennessy, Inc.; Acoustical design: Dr. Cyril M. Harris; Lighting: Jules Fisher & Paul Marantz, Inc.; Builder: Naugle-Leck. Eventually the curtain wall on the north side was wrapped with colorful graphics. When Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates received the 1981 AIA Firm Award, note was given to the building, as well as who recommended them to help with the design: "the firm attempted to rework conventional notions of what a concert hall should be. It has none of the traditional symbolism that attaches to \'concert hall.\' Because the clients\' principal concern was acoustics, they first hired Cyril Harris and then chose HHPA on his recommendation. At Harris\'s insistence, the architect physically isolated the concert hall from lobby spaces, treating the latter in duct-and-girder style, while the red brick, windowless hall sits as a large lump surrounded by steel and glass, efficient-looking service spaces." The original design shared the cover of the March 1981 issue of the AIA Journal, dedicated to Minneapolis as host city for that year\'s national AIA Convention. In August 1982, P/A Editor John Morris Dixon, FAIA, placed it a list of his "favorite American buildings built from 1960 to the present" as part of an editorial, along with St. John\'s Abbey Church and IDS Center. Starting in 2007, Minnesota Orchestra CEO Michael Henson began marketing a $90M, transformative expansion and renovation (designed by Toronto-based KPMB) before the economy tanked; a 2009 revision was scaled down, but still unsympathetically altered the lobby and public spaces. The $40M project went forward from 2012-13, doubling the size and replacing glassy curtain walls and charming exterior blue vents with an anonymous wall of gray stone and glass; the orange concert hall seats and balconies were redone in a near-black color, with 365 fewer seats to allow for wider seats with more legroom. The conservative addition isn\'t terrible, it just erased the character of the original front, and does the opposite of the original plan: it makes the building imposing and classist, there is no more playful charm--in the end, the moneyed and privileged won out. Coincidentally, the remodel took place during an ugly labor strike between musicians and the orchestra. The back and sides of the hall (which include studios, rehearsing, and dressing rooms) still retain some of the original character. Address also 1100 Marquette Ave.'),

A plaza over underground parking facilities and auto-bank will provide ice-skating rink in winter, outdoor display space in warm weather."

Over 5,100 tons of structural steel in the frame work, 19,000 cubic yards of concrete, 1,955 windows; 2 kinds of granite and 3 kinds of marble were used for trim: The plaza and entrance to the auto bank use charcoal black granite from Cold Springs (MN); The bank\'s main entrance was trimmed in gray Mount Airy granite (Vermont); The elevator lobbies used Imperial Danby marble (Vermont); the walls of the main banking level used Italian Fior de Pesco marble.

First National Bank began buying up property on the block in 1946 to eventually use for a new building (it occupied the Soo Line Building at the time). It hired the architects in 1955. When announced in June 1956, the plan was for "at least" 25-stories, with an initial sketch fairly close to the final design as built.

Its construction was viewed as important early building in the redevelopment of the area surrounding the university, in the hope its quality would inspire similar development around it. The co-op State Credit Union, aimed at State and University of Minnesota employees, desired "a restrained and dignified physical expression that would create the image of a progressive and dynamic institution." Rapson addressed this with a single concrete canopy covering activities fragments into various articulated spaces, which P/A described as the "duality" of the building. Most prominent is the large, waffle slab roof--a strong form Rapson described as possessing a "quiet, monumental discipline." The roof is supported by 16 tapered cruciform, concrete columns to open up, in Rapson\'s words, "maximum plan flexibility and over-all discipline." The square roof had skylights and artificial lighting incorporated into the coffers of the exposed waffle slab, per its feature in P/A, these served to "reiterate the asymmetrical plan--having skylights project below the level of the ceiling, placing these sky lights over the major interior spaces so that they further define them, incorporating artificial lighting into the skylights and coffers to further vary their depth [. . .] The result is a ceiling composed of projections and setbacks that reinforces the spatial variety of the building."

Architect Barry Bryne (1883-1967) was an internationally-noted architect based in Evanston (IL); he began as a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright (1902-07) working in the Prairie Style, before developing his own more simplified approach to form after WWI, implementing the Expressionist style. Byrne designed two similar churches around the same time, St. Columba and St. Francis Xavier Church (1949) in Kansas City, MO (the latter is better known), and both of them were subject of a 9-page feature in the February 1951 issue of Architectural Record. The magazine noted they "have an almost identical and very evidently symbolic form. The shapes of these buildings, unfamiliar and hence likely topics for much discussion, evolved only after years of thoughtful consideration of the requirements truly fundamental to a Catholic church. The buildings\' fish-like forms are not wholly incidental, but neither were they forced into this symbolic plan." Byrne stated "In Catholicism there is a basic doctrinal factor, the Divinity of Christ, which admits no equivocation. The continuation of the belief into time and material form may be said to occur in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the consecration of bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ. This consecration is the basic element in the Mass and together with what surrounds it of prayer and action is a liturgy. The Eucharistic liturgy is the actual, essential form of worship in the Catholic church. No other form of worship approaches it in importance or challenges its preeminence. A Catholic church building, then, is primarily a space in which, first, the ministering priest can offer the Eucharistic liturgy; and second, the congregation and assemble and participate in this offering. A church structure has value insofar as it is harmonious with the idea of Eucharistic liturgy, and to the degree it accentuates it and is favorable to the congregation\'s participation in it." AR drew a comparison with his earlier churches, notably his Church of Christ the King (1927-31) in Cork, Ireland, which approached creating an interior space focused on the 12ft-wide Eucharistic altar and uniting it in an orderly fashion the 97ft-wide seating area. His design transitioned in the 1930s, an example of that is Pierre, South Dakota\'s Church of SS. Peter & Paul (finished in 1942). The magazine noted efforts to "refine the plan resulted in the fish shape. After the plan was evolved, its evident symbolism was exploited." The ability to construct spaces with such wide spans as St. Columba benefited from advents in technology that were not present. St. Francis Xavier was referred to as "the fish church" for its footprint resembling the symbolic ichthys, though St. Columba has somehow avoided the appellation. The pastor Michael Casey insisted that the bell tower built to look like an Irish round tower; per a contemporary report in The Minneapolis Star, "He said it would combine the ancient and modern, recall the youth of the church\'s patron saint, St. Columba, who played at the foot of such a tower in Ireland." The church was sited diagonally on the site. The use of a hollow-core floor slab heating system was noted in Architectural Record\'s October 1950 issue: "The hollow centers of Flexicore cast concrete building slabs were used as ducts for a split system of warm-air radiant panel heating in the Church of St. Columba in St. Paul, Minn. Architect Barry Byrne devised a system which sends warm air through the floor, making it a radiant panel, then passes it into the room through a baseboard grill. Air is carried back to the furnace through a central return grill. Many advantages are claimed for such a system: air temperature is raised quickly, overcoming the effect of thermal lag in the floor; the floor need only be warm, not hot; air does not stagnate in the room; and air entering on outside walls warms window areas. The concrete building slabs are hollow cast in 6 by 12 in. cross section, and in inch variations of length up to 22 ft 6 in." The masonry pier structure is surfaced outside with Indiana limestone, inside with Winona stone and integrally colored plaster. The walls curving walls feature narrow openings with glass block to focus attention on the sanctuary and shelter and unify the congregation. A flat ceiling suspended from steel roof deck controls distribution of light and sound. In a coincidence the priest at time of construction was Auxiliary Bishop Byrne. An earlier church on the site was razed in September 1948 to make room. The structure cost $600,000. Builder: McGough Bros. Dedicated on June 11, 1950.

The design reflects the living pattern of the larger community, with separation of activities and privacy for different age groups. With the need to separate older and younger age groups as well as meet the needs of the 4 types of activities (administrative, meeting, social, and physical education), Parker created 7 areas: (1) meeting-board-community room; (2) auditorium-kitchen-drama workshop; (3) administrative offices; (4) central foyer, lounge, and lounge courtyard, (5) senior\'s lounge & courtyard; (6) game room, youth lounge, playrooms, and courtyard; (7) sports area with gym, weight area, handball, swimming pool, lockers, etc. Parker wanted an expression that "community implies diversity and cohesiveness; that there was a need to organize the many and diverse room sizes and functions so as to achieve a cohesive whole." He also needed to address the site\'s lack of desirable views; the need to "break" long corridors necessitated by a long building on a long site; and the desire to express on the exterior the form of the interior activities, thereby breaking up the facade into a series of distinct but related molded forms. Radial corners were the principal plan device Parker used (in his words a "recognizable repetitive form") to achieve flow and separation both inside and out: the convex and concave manifestations both stop the eye and lead the path around the corner. Structural system of masonry bearing walls of brick and lightweight concrete block, with precast concrete floor planks over excavated areas and poured concrete slabs on grade; steel bar joist and metal deck roof (except for long spans where precast concrete tees rest on special precast bearing inserts); medium dark bricks spandrels and entrance canopies of black stucco with black and green marble chips embedded; lintels and garden wall caps used concrete with sandblast finish; interior walls brick in corridors; subsoil conditions dictated raising the building out of the ground so the foundation would occur at the rock level 3ft below existing grade, 1st floor was thus placed 6ft above sidewalk level. The original designs had some aspects reduced for economy: it was planned with even more brick, and an additional courtyard between the auditorium and meeting rooms that was changed to interior space. In critiquing his own work, Parker admitted the separation of areas was perhaps too successful, per the client: "The isolation of noise and the control of circulation, separation of functions were too carefully controlled. Even when being used by 300 to 400 people, the building lacks this bustle, vitality, etc. [. . .] I feel that had we designed to allow for more noise and confusion, the building internally could have been more alive, vital, and exciting in terms of one\'s awareness of the human interactions taking place within the building." He also felt more could have been made of the "soft corner-interlocking volume" idiom, "In retrospect, I feel that we were too timid in our exploitation of these elements. The building could\'ve been much more broken down into related units."

The project was first presented to the Minneapolis Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) by the Knutson Companies (local company developing the Gateway District) in September 1960 with plans to begin construction in summer 1961, however there were multiple delays due to condemnation proceedings (to obtain the 170,000sf parcel), approving the closure of streets, and securing financing; the project finally moved forward once NYC-based Kratter Corporation joined the project.

Subject of a very positive review in the October 1975 issue of Progressive Architecture (P/A, then the biggest magazine on modernism), which noted it "suitably combine wood and concrete to create a form expressing the traditional and modern psychic affinities of the urban Indian." Set in motion in 1968, by the Minneapolis Model Cities program and elected leaders in the American Indian community, as a first-of-its-kind vehicle to spur a renewed sense of identity, and portray a truer self-image than had been imparted to American Indians previously. Funding included U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development neighborhood facilities grants ($1,705,580), the city ($534,178), and Model Cities ($350,000). Although Hodne/Stageberg had no Native American ancestry at the time they were selected, they worked with American Indian architect Denby Deegan, and hired part-Arapahoe and Shoshone Dennis Sun Rhodes as an associate to more accurately integrate traditional design motifs into the physical solutions. The community leaders did not want the design to implement cliché style elements of American Indian culture, they also requested use of natural materials and open planning. The 42,000sf two-level structure was designed like a pavilion to host 3 separate functions: social, cultural, and recreational (athletic facilities were intended to ensure continual engagement with the community). Wood is the dominant building material for structural, cladding and aesthetic purposes; the southern façade of the gymnasium features a geometric mural in wood parquet by American Indian artist George Morrison. Expansive use of window brings in natural light. The structure employs 112ft long glulam fir beams supported by concrete columns and load-bearing end walls. The exterior implements a large outdoor amphitheater for pow-wows, with two additional areas for the events located on the site\'s grounds. Hodne composed the structure so the first part of the building most people would see is the pointed corner of the double-height library/exhibit space jutting out, both walkers and drivers would be drawn to its presence. The main entrance originally had a long, "processional" concrete exterior ramp leading up to it--the position of the ramp sliced through the middle to separate the large gymnasium on one side from the museum/library/social service wing on the other; unfortunately, this proved to be one of the design\'s misfires: the ramp became the least-used entrance, and was ultimately removed due to issues with homeless people seeking shelter underneath (it was replaced with an additional entrance). The October \'75 P/A critique unfortunately uses a cavalier approach to the Native American image that touches a line of what would be considered culturally insensitive today, but in doing so reflects the plight of the American Indian community to gain serious attention as it asserted itself further in the 1970s. That issue aside, it noted "Clearly here success has more to do with a design that responds to an abstract level of concerns of a particular interest group. In this case the architectural solution was required to perform a lot of tasks--from providing workable integrated spaces for a range of activities, to generating a focus of community spirit, to making a dramatic but unpretentious statement about Indian social and cultural aspirations in the larger milieu. The fact that it could do all this is a prodigious accomplishment."

The structure originally contained electrical and automotive shops, woodworking, printing, drafting and art rooms, home economics laboratories, medical offices, library, administrative offices, special classrooms, a sound studio and control room, audio-visual facilities, and photography lab. The structure had a built-in closed-circuit TV system to allow student teachers to observe classroom work without being present in the classroom themselves.  There was a small theater rather than a large auditorium, with performances repeated in the small hall until everyone had seen them. In between the large classrooms were small conference rooms to be used for various purposes.

An interconnected complex of 11 buildings (sometimes counted a 6 building) ranging from 4 to 40 stories across 8-acres, consisting of 1,303 mixed-income housing units and ancillary services, intended as only the beginning of an enormous project (Cedar-Riverside new town). Designed in a visually striking, neo-Corbusian style--with bold concrete structures, multi-colored panels, and laced with walkways. Each of the buildings was designed with its own community room; an elevated plaza was designed to house a variety of shops, a daycare center, health clinic, amphitheater and an outdoor sculpture garden; parking was provided under the plaza; the complex featured several parks and playgrounds. The project aimed to mix the income levels of residents: Over half of the apartments are subsidized, and spread among higher-income units in all but one building. All residents could choose from 3 dwelling types: the typical apartments found in the high- and mid-rises; 2-story "maisonettes" in mid and low-rise structures, and "one-two-bedroom apartments with multiple exposures." The 1975 AIA Jury consisted of Richard Meier, John Desmond, Gertrude Kerbis, Donald E. Olsen, and Alfred Price (student); they felt "The structures are diverse in architectural character as well as in height, effecting an apparently spontaneous urban domain"; and admired its ability to maintain a human scale despite its gargantuan size, and it "meshes well with the surrounding neighborhood conditions both new and rehabilitated." The HUD awards jury had an interdisciplinary make-up of C. Randolph Wedding (architect-mayor of St. Petersburg, FL), social psychologist Robert B. Bechtel, planner Sheryl L. Handler, landscape architect Ervin H. Zube, president of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Agency John B. Williams, and HUD urban design program officer, Andrew F. Euston Jr (as professional advisor). While the HUD panels of this era generally avoided high-rises, they "found this vertical residential complex to reflect careful attention and amenities," noting that "ground level settings were introduced with particular care for the needs to establish viable community life."

Considered as the "first visible manifestation of the nation\'s first new town-in-town; it is, as such, something of a laboratory of physical and social planning--and it is, currently, in the middle of a battlefield." The battle came from those opposed to the density, and came from environmental concerns that mostly veiled NIMBYism from existing neighbors. Cedar-Riverside was envisioned as having 30,000 residents packed into a 340-acre area. Cedar Square West was to be joined by 10 similar complexes over the next two decades to comprise the town. Lawsuits filed by those parties against the project effectively halted the future development. Further complicating matters was poor care for the structures in the 1980s and 1990s, causing the buildings to be derided as a failure: Cedar-Riverside Associates managed Cedar Square West for the first decade only to fumble its role as a manager and caretaker, declaring bankruptcy in 1984; Sherman Associates bought the complex in 1988 and renamed it Riverside Plaza. It became well known as the significant spot in the flow of immigrants from the Somali diaspora. The project received some reevaluation as the 2000s went on, and its significant was ultimately recognized with its listing on the National Register of Historic Places on December 28, 2010, and a $132M renovation in 2011-12.

The result is an arrangement of galleries that spiral up around a central staircase and open onto rooftop terraces. AIA jury [Henry N. Cobb (chair), Gerald L. Allison, John G. Dinkeloo, Harry M. Weese, Harry C. Wolf, Milton L. Grigg (adviser), Antonin Aeck (student rep)] commented: "In this small, ingeniously planned museum, architecture unassumingly but effectively serves the arts of painting and sculpture.

When Barnes\' firm won the 1980 AIA firm award, the profile included the Walker. The adjacent Minneapolis Sculpture Garden, also designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and run by the Walker, was created in 1988 and redone in 2015-17. Major changes began in the aughts: The museum purchased the adjacent 1947 midcentury office building (North American Life & Casualty Co. building by Lang and Raugland) and demolished it to prepare for the 2002-2005, $67M addition of a major new wing designed by Herzog & de Meuron, based on a "town square" concept meant to open up building through accessible gathering spaces; it complements the minimalist brick tower created by Barnes with an abstract geometric tower made of aluminum mesh panels. Simultaneously, the Guthrie opted to build a new theater in the Mill District, resulting in the controversial decision by the Walker to demolish Ralph Rapson\'s award-winning modern masterpiece and give the space to more green area and an extension of its sculpture park. In a glowing review of the 2005 add\'n, The New York Times\' Nicolai Ouroussoff commented "The original Walker, designed by Edward Larabee Barnes, is the kind of blank brick Modernist box that not so long ago would have been widely derided by historicists.

The building was the product of a major design competition in 1946, advised by Roy Jones, head of the University of Minnesota School of Architecture, and judged by Leon Arnal, Harvey Wiley Corbett, and John Wellborn Root Jr. After examining 86 entrants, Cavin\'s design came in 1st place in October 1946, earning him $5,000 (equivalent of over $67,000 in 2021) [2nd prize: Suren Pilafian (Detroit); 3rd: Don Hatch (NY); 4th: Rollin C. Chapin & Henry W. Stone (MN)]. At the time, Cavin described himself as "just an unknown" who created the design by working on it at night at his Washington, DC firm job. His winning design, mostly realized in final implementation, was described in the Minneapolis Tribune as "a modernistic, space-saving design composed of two wings connected by a four-story office building, the ground floor of which is an open arcade, part of a plaza 140 feet wide by 200 feet long." The design included the reflecting pool set in the north section of the plaza, with an auditorium and war memorial museum planned for the east wing. The jury commended Cavin for his "masterly" arrangement of the 3 main groups comprising the building, and noted "the plaza and the disposition of the building around and over it creates a monumental composition consistent with the memorial purpose of the building." The design was unanimously affirmed by the officers and directors of the Minnesota AIA, who noted by resolution "It is our opinion that the winning design is a commendable solution for a memorial and office building design which will harmonize with the capitol group and be a credit to the state." Because Cavin had no staff of his own, he agreed to associate with Ingemann & Bergstedt. The win led the 31-year-old to move to Minnesota (although from Philadelphia, his in-laws were already in Minneapolis), he stayed, practiced architecture, and taught until retiring to Vermont. Delays related to obtaining and clearing the land, as well as rises in building costs, pushed construction back to 1953-55 (Builder: Hagstrom Const. Co.), with only the first floor of the plan built (with a covered walkway in the location of the originally planned tower) as the state did not have the funds to pay for the increased construction costs of the entire design as approved 8 years prior. This led the resulting, partially completed building (now a rambler) to be derided as "a monstrosity" by State Representative Clarence Langley (Red Wing) in March 1955. Newly elected Governor Orville Freeman pushed for $1.3M of additional funding to complete the building as designed, but it continued to struggle for state funding in lieu of other projects. At the same time, the reflecting pool and mechanical statue, "Promise of Youth" (1952) by Alonzo Hauer, were similarly beset by problems after its installation in 1958 and required repair. Eventually the longtime executive secretary of the State Veterans Building Commission resigned in protest in August 1965, noting that although his commission finished more than 90% of its assigned work on the capitol grounds, the work on the Veterans Service Building was neglected for over 15 years. Finally, in the early 1970s, work commenced on the originally planned central tower, completed in 1972. In Cavin\'s obituary, his longtime friend, Ralph Rapson (who hired him onto the faculty of the University of Minnesota School of Architecture in 1954), said "In some ways, the Veterans Service Building was his finest piece of design." His daughter-in-law said the design came from Cavin\'s training under Bauhaus-founder Walter Gropius at Harvard. Building was originally going to be named the War Memorial Building, but it was changed during a 1945 appropriations session by the Minnesota Legislature with gave it a $2M budget. '),

As a complete religious unit, it comprises a main nave with narthex, offices, two classroom units, assembly-dining hall and a chapel to be built at a future date. All these units are arranged around an open courtyard, which in effect becomes an extension of the park just across Stevens Avenue. The dominant mass of the building, the nave, is placed at the focal point of the site and because of its height, four stories, will form an architectural accent on the broad square which borders the park area.

As noted in the October 1974 issue of Progressive Architecture (P/A, then the biggest magazine on modernism), it added two wings to the original 1914 structure by McKim, Mead and White; the additions adjoin each end "attempting to suggest that the [original main entrance on the northern] facade itself is on display as an artifact as well as the museum contents;" while appearing symmetrical on the northern façade, the eastern wing is much larger as it extends to and includes a new Children\'s Theater (with a new main entrance lobby in between). The exterior uses white glazed face brick, dark colored aluminum curtain wall, tinted glass. The project began in 1965 when the Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts hired Hodne/Stageberg (which had expanded MCAD) to produce a development concept for the entire complex; their research "concluded that the museum should serve as a regional center for scholarly research and at the same time attempt to become a focus for community activity" while combating the community\'s general image of the museum as stuffy, austere, and static. For the actual project, the Society decided to bring in an international architect, and Tange was selected for his interest in working with the existing building. Local associated architects on the $26M combined MIA/Children\'s Theater and MCAD projects were Parker Klein. Economic factors led Tange to drop his original preference for granite and precast concrete, where concerns over the energy investment reduced the amount of glass used in the design. What was originally planned as a skylight became an artificially lit luminous ceiling (noted for its success in replicating the desire effect). The program was to double the exhibition and office space by adding 110,000-sq-ft while blending in with both the 1915 Beaux Arts structure and the existing neighborhood. In its March 1975 review, P/A was underwhelmed, feeling it did not fully accomplish the program and was "not a representative example of this talented architect\'s finest work." P/A\'s contention was "They do not blend harmoniously with the existing buildings on the site, nor with the small-scale residential neighborhood surrounding them. Nor on the other hand, do they succeed as assertive works of architectural merit that can stand alone. They straddle that gray area in between." It further took issue with the execution of the site plan, which aimed design an arts "village" with the museum, Children\'s Theater, and MCAD surrounding a central park: "But such large-scale elements with identical materials and massing hardly achieve these picturesque ideals. The buildings are grouped around a central open space that performs no real function. Furthermore, the museum wings are still oriented to the street in Beaux Arts alignment with the McKim Mead & White structure. Thus the central space remains their \'backyard.\'" P/A criticized moving the entrance, saying it "means that the old facade no longer serves any purpose. Kept only for its image value, it thus becomes an artifact much like the contents on display within." The critique speculated several root causes for the disappointment: Questioning whether Tange was familiar enough with American architecture (and its native application of Beaux Arts) to design a harmonious addition; whether the distance between his offices in Japan and Minneapolis, combined with a forced fast-track design/build timeline (which he was not in favor of) led to too many areas of decision not being fully worked out; and whether Parker Klein was similar enough in approach to truly translate his vision. The P/A assessment was roundly castigated by Twin Cities architectural historian Eileen Michels in the letters of the May 1975 issue. Designer: Kenzo Tange, his firm was then called "Kenzo Tange & URTEC" (derived from the term urbanist architect); Associated architects: Parker Klein Associates (principal-in-charge: Leonard S.

The building was designed with two main entrances: the outpatient clinic of Glen Lake Sanatorium used 3rd Ave S, the health department entrance was 4th St S. The opening was subject of a laudatory multi-part series outlining its offerings by reporter Abe Altrowitz of The Minneapolis Star. It was dedicated in May 1958, to coincide with Minneapolis\' hosting of the 10th anniversary session of the World Health Organization; ahead of the conference, renowned doctor Howard A. Rusk, MD (founder of the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine) wrote an article in The New York Times calling the Twin Cities the "World\'s Health Capital" while specifically drawing attention to the newly finished Public Health Center as a symbol of why the metro was at the forefront of public health and welfare. Its construction was an important step of the Gateway Center Urban Renewal Project; a redevelopment area planned by Robert G. Cerny (and first sketched by his firm, as Long & Thorshsov, in 1945); the building was the first public building constructed in the plan--a priority pushed by various public and private city leaders, including the Mayor of Minneapolis and the city\'s Chamber of Commerce. It was followed closely by a new public library and federal courthouse (both also planned by Thorshov & Cerny). The 3 public buildings were planned as a part of the original wave of development in the new civic center when the greater project was first formally presented in February 1952 (then called the Lower Loop Development Plan) by the City Engineer. Mayor Eric G. Hoyer made funding the center a "first consideration" in the 1954 budget. Originally envisioned as a 7-story, L-shaped building during requests for funding in November 1953. Thorshov & Cerny was engaged in April 1954, after a one-month delay caused by city council squabbling for a smaller budget than initially requested. The architect\'s first drawings were for an 8-story structure with basement garage. Land cleared in July 1955. An editorial in the Minneapolis Tribune called the May 1956 ground-breaking "a dramatic moment for many citizens who had long dreamed of a civic center in the lower loop. The ceremonies were symbolic of years of careful planning toward that end." Built for $2,858,614 (with $970,202 in federal funds); finished ahead of schedule (December 1957 rather than Spring \'58 as projected in \'56, dedication still delayed to coordinate with WHO session).

Noted in the July 1971 issue of Progressive Architecture (P/A, then the biggest magazine on modernism), "The real keys for the system are four 93-ton weldments at each corner of the towers; they anchor the catenaries and connect trusses and towers." Those end towers also house stairs, restrooms, and other service-related access; a third tower on the east handled elevators and acted as the ground-floor lobby, but is not related to the structural design of the building (vaults were located in the 3 underground levels). The concrete caissons underneath the support towers extend 35 ft down to bedrock. Originally, one of the most striking aspects of the finished building was it only touched the ground on the 3 towers, with the rest of the building suspended above to emphasize the suspension the structure provided. The exterior is sheathed in glass, granite and aluminum. The suspension design removed the need for internal support pillars within the office floors. The arrangement of the windows draw attention the suspension design.

Unfortunately the Plaza was better in photos than in practice: its original design was subject of a less than enthusiastic evaluation in the August 1978 issue of the AIA Journal, especially as contrasted against the comparative success of IDS Center—the reviewer noted how the design was not particularly inviting and correspondingly lacked much life or practical use in its forbidding nature (however it was already a popular urban skate park). A major anchor of the Gateway Center redevelopment project, the $30M, 13-story building was the second home of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis (by far the smallest of the 12 Federal Reserve banks in terms of assets). There were construction problems that led to leaky windows and the cost of renovation (especially asbestos mitigation) led the Federal Reserve decided to build a new complex a few blocks away in 1997 rather than renovate the structure; it was then sold and subject of a substantial $65M renovation and compromising addition in 2000-2002 by Walsh Bishop Associates enclosed the lowest level, attached a large addition to the east, and converted a plaza on the west side into a grassy space; the privately-owned building was renamed Marquette Plaza; from 2002-2005 it was the temporary home of the central branch of the Minneapolis Public Library while the old, Mid-Century building was demolished and replaced by a new modern design; after a $7M renovation in 2018-19 (ESG Architecture & Design), the building name was shortened to The Marq.'),

Hill. The house that was designed for them was originally squarish in shape, and featured 3 equal-sized bedrooms on the second floor (with one bath). The clients wanted a house that took "advantage of the site and the exposure and the view" while also fitting "the modern style of living." Like Frank Lloyd Wright\'s recently completed Malcolm Willey House (1934) across the street, it was designed to maximize the southern exposure (using a passive solar design to shield windows from the summer sun while letting in winter sun), and offer less exposure to the colder northern face. The exterior was flat roof, with exterior walls sheathed in horizontal redwood on the lower floor and resin-bonded plywood on the upper floor; the concrete driveway was intentionally tinted blue as a whimsical gesture. A balcony extended on the southern face of the upper floor, with access from all 3 bedrooms. It featured ribbon windows, and little glazing facing the street with its one-car garage. The interior created warmth with exposed brick, gumwood veneer, ample wood built-ins, and engineered wood products used in more industrial capacities but offering durability and modular uses.\n\nFaulkner & Ziegfeld, who had met while studying landscape design at Harvard University, joined the faculty at Minnesota and co-taught a class on "Art Today" that looked at contemporary trends in modern art, design, and architecture. Gerald (Jerry) Hill was teaching a similar course called "Music Today." The 3 men saw an opportunity to move the arts forward and commission a house of importance, finding interested parties in the newly formed independent firm of Close & Scheu (the name became Close Assoc. in 1940).\n\nThe architect couple, which had recently formed an independent firm after working for Magney, Tusler & Setter, was looking to design modern structures; this was their first major built commission. Elizabeth (Lisl) Scheu was born and educated in Vienna, where she grew up in a home designed by early modernist Adolf Loos (Ornament and Crime); Winston (Win) Close was born in Appleton, MN, and both met in graduate school at MIT; Winston also faculty at the University of Minnesota. Before seeing this commission through to completion, the Closes were working on several other projects that included looking to design a house with recently arrived faculty member B. F. Skinner, but it never came to fruition before he left the institution (and became a household name).\n\nFunding was difficult due to the radical departure from what typical houses looked like in Minnesota; lenders feared it would never sell for the $12,000 it cost to build.\n\nFaulkner & Ziegfeld moved to Columbia University in NYC in 1939, and later co-authored the 1941 book Art Today, which examined the mid-century style across the arts. Jerry Hill would later commission Close Assoc. to design him a cabin on Lake Vermilion, "Thunderhead" (1957). The house was sold in 1939 to another Professor, Benjamin Lippincott, who hired the Closes to do a 1940 addition to the rear which added living areas.\n\nLike the Willey House next door, some of the southern view of the Mississippi River valley were obscured not by the construction of the freeway, but by the maturation of tree in neighborhoods to the south (but the freeway wall certainly does not help).\n\nPrior to this house, the site was originally supposed to have a house designed by then-Los Angeles-based Richard Neutra (another Austrian émigré), but the client moved away. \n\nThe house has been referred to by several names, each related to its importance: As a client, it was referred to as the Ray Faulkner House in its initial design, though the architects also referred to it as Opus One; the work of the three bachelors who commissioned it also led to it being referred to as the "Art Today" house; the owners after 1939, who commissioned the 1940 addition that gave it its final shape, resulted in the name Benjamin and Gertrude Lippincott House.\n\nThe house has been featured in numerous publications, notably Larry Millett\'s book "Minnesota Modern: Architecture and Life at Midcentury" (2015) and Jane King Hession\'s "Elizabeth Scheu Close.

The 3-bedroom house is a transition between Wright\'s work in both Prairie and Usonian styles. The layout steps away from the historic compartmentalization of interior design by creating an open living and dining area, with a kitchen separated by only a wall of glass and shelves (to allow for visibility, the first time Wright added this to a design). The living room includes a pair of large, triangular clerestory windows on both ends. The house implemented an early use of passive solar design: a 9\'x15\' trellis (with 3 integrated skylights) extends, cantilevered from the large south-facing windows to shade the hot summer sun but allow in the lower, winter sun for heating the interior. The design uses red brick and cypress. The fireplace is impressive with a tall opening. The floors were done in mortared brick pavers, save for the kitchen in red linoleum, the flooring continues into the exterior terrace—blurring the line between inside and out. The exterior terrace features a triangular shape. The house was designed around the southern view, which included downtown Minneapolis and the Mississippi River Valley (more on this below). Original builder: Alfred C. Dahleen; mason: Nels Blenoff. Sometimes referred to in literature as "Gardenwall" (or "The Garden Wall" a name Wright gave it, perhaps now it could be "Freewaywall?"). Willey was an administrator at the University of Minnesota; in June 1932, his wife Nancy Willey sent a letter to Wright asking if he would be able to provide them a "creation of art" for a budget of "about $8,000" and the architect, in a tight financial situation due to the Great Depression and still dealing with the legacy of his personal life\'s foibles, needed the commission (he hadn\'t had a client in 3 years). It was the first real world architectural work for the recently founded Taliesin Fellowship. The current design is the second design that Wright conceived for the Willeys, as the first, 2-story design proved too costly for the family (Wright suggested they build it in phases). In a moment of frustration, Nancy Willey famously wrote Wright: "I do not want a seventeen thousand dollar house, even at twelve or ten thousand dollars. I want an eight to ten thousand dollar house at eight to ten thousand dollars. Can I have it?" The home ended up a modest 1,200 square feet (110 m2) at a cost of $10,000. Featured in the November 1935 issue of Architectural Record, including sketch, floor/site plan, and photo showing how the living room was oriented towards the original view. Work to re-roof and renovate the house (c.1960s) was done by noted local builder Rodney W. Billman, hired through a friendship between Billman\'s wife and Willey\'s second wife, noted jurist Betty Whitlock Washburn. The Willey\'s sold the home in 1963 to a family that later sold it to a Wright aficionado who only sporadically occupied the home. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1984. In dire shape, it was sold in 2002 to design aficionado Steve Sikora who gave the house a desperately-needed renovation; the process was featured in the September/October 2008 issue of the Old House Journal and Sikora wrote useful articles on the house\'s history for the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. An urban myth (repeated even in the NRHP application) was what became I-94 was rerouted to avoid demolishing the house; this is completely unsubstantiated and debunked by Sicora himself in the series he wrote for the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. Another urban myth was the view was completely ruined by the freeway and subsequent freeway noise wall, from the house and yard rise above the level of the wall and still offers the original view of downtown Minneapolis; however, the view of the river was obscured by the decades of tree growth between it and the house (the area was initially deforested by lumbermen for the Weyerhaeuser mill).

Commissioned by widow June Halvorson Alworth, she married Robert J. Starkey soon after its completion, which is why the house is sometimes referred to as the Alworth-Starkey House. Breuer wanted the house to take advantage of the sloping site with views of Lake Superior, so he crafted 2 larger volumes cantilevered over 8 tapered wooden supports that transfer their weight to steel rods before touching the ground. The volumes reflect his concept of a "binuclear plan," where common/living areas were separate from sleeping and children\'s spaces. The living and sleeping areas were originally almost completely elevated: Breuer paved the area underneath and defined the space with fieldstone walls and an outdoor fireplace. The exterior used board-and-batten siding, and the facades facing the lake featured large expanses of windows with practical and aesthetically pleasing sunshades. A third volume, the garage, is on grade and is constructed of fieldstone and painted brick.

Young (professor of history at St. Thomas MN). To find an architect for what would be a massive, long-range project involving not just the Abbey Church (up to 19 other buildings) the Benedictine order when through a multi-stage, democratic process of nominating candidates. Rev. Cloud Meinberg, member of the building committee was a trained architect, and helped identify the initial 12 to pursue: Hermann Baur (Switzerland), Pietro Belluschi, Albert Bosslet (Germany), Marcel Breuer, Barry Byrne, Walter Gropius, Robert Kramreiter (Austria), Joseph D. Murphy, Richard Neutra, Eero Saarinen, Thomas Sharp (England), and Rudolf Schwarz (Germany). Each of the 12 were invited to share their interest in the project. Abbot Baldwin Wilfred Dworschak\'s original letter of invitation stated: "The Benedictine tradition at its best challenges us to think boldly and to cast our ideals in forms which will be valid for centuries to come, shaping them with all the genius of present-day materials and techniques." Belluschi and Saarinen declined. After replies, the monks voted to pursue interviews with 5: Breuer, Byrne, Gropius, Murphy, and Neutra. After interviews, a written ballot selected Breuer. The monks supplied about 20% of the labor involved in the construction of the new monastic wing. Stoddard observed "in various ways and very simply Breuer has realized a true monastic character in the design of this building. Today\'s monastery is an outgrowth of fourteen centuries of balance between constancy to the Rule on the one hand and adjustment to the changing social world on the other. The spirit of the great abbey church of the past will be preserved in modern times, and the new church at Saint John\'s in its structure will interpret the liturgy in an architectural language as immediate and as direct as that of the Middle Ages." Project Architect: Hamilton Smith; Supervising Architects: Traynor & Hermanson (St. Cloud); Project Coordinator: Val Michelson; Structural Consultant on Theory: Pier Luigi Nervi; Structural Engineers: Weisenfeld, Hayward & Leon; Mechanical Engineers: Gausman and Moore; Art Coordinator: Frank Kacmarcik (who later had a house designed by Breuer in St. Paul); Builder: McGough Construction Co.; Construction Superintendent: Ted Hoffmeyer. Breuer wanted fellow Bauhaus instructor Josef Albers to design the stained glass on the prominent northern façade (the "front" of the church) but the monks opposed his abstract design and instead selected St. John\'s faculty member Bronislaw Bak, who created the monumental design using many hexagonal forms. Breuer was still able to have Albers design the glass window above the altar; when Albers received the AIA\'s fine arts medal for 1975, they included a mention of that work. Included in Alan K. Lathrop\'s 2003 book "Churches of Minnesota." Used handsomely in an April 1963 ad for Pozzolith concrete. Architectural Forum showed the church three times: in 1954 (as a project), in 1961, and again in 1964, calling it "perhaps the most relevant of major American churches to the current age of reform." Part of a major 1964-65 national traveling exhibition of religious architecture, "Churches and Temples: Postwar Architecture," that launched at the Pepsi-Cola Gallery in NYC (it was located at 500 Park Ave) sponsored by the New York Chapter AIA and nationally by the American Federation of Arts, which featured 2 Breuer designed out of 21 selections (the other was his Priory, Bismarck, ND ...coincidentally Breuer was on the selection committee, along with Lathrop Douglass, Percival Goodman, P/A Editor Jan C. Rowan, and editor of Editor of Liturgical Arts, Maurice Lavanoux), the catalog noted "In this age, we can no longer profitably repeat past styles, but must find concepts for houses of worship that are meaningful for congregations of today and tomorrow." In August 1982, P/A Editor John Morris Dixon, FAIA, placed it a list of his "favorite American buildings built from 1960 to the present" as part of an editorial, along with Orchestra Hall and IDS Center.'),

Designed to house 7 city cultural institutions: Theater St. Paul, St. Paul Art Center, Civic Opera, Philharmonic Society, Science Museum, Schubert Club, and Council of Arts and Sciences. Originally planned as a collaboration between noted architect and Dean of the UMN\'s School of Architecture Ralph Rapson and Ellerbe & Co. Rapson described the pairing with Ellerbe as "a shotgun wedding. We were just incompatible bed-fellows." An early version of Rapson\'s design received a 1961 Citation from Progressive Architecture magazine (then the biggest magazine on architecture) in their annual Design Awards Program for work not yet built (jury: Charles R. Colbert (chair), O\'Neil Ford, Philip C. Johnson, Walter A. Netsch, Jr., Chloethiel Woodard Smith), in the same year they also awarded his design for the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis; in 1961 the project was called the "Arts and Science Civic Education Center for City of St. Paul, Minnesota" and was to "provide meeting rooms, lounges, offices, rehearsal and performance space for the twelve-member organizations of the Arts and Science Council of St. Paul and its several associate organizations" as well as provide (1) "a science museum for physical and natural science exhibits, science and industry displays, children\'s classes and exhibits, library and sales desk facilities, lecture and movie research facilities," (2) "a theater section for dramatic productions, for concerts, lectures, and theater classes," (3) "a gallery section for permanent and temporary exhibits, picture sales and related activities, children\'s and adult\'s classes" while also allowing for a future 1,100-seat theater. The 95,000sf, multilevel design won over the jury for resolving the many program requirements. Rapson planned it to "maintain the separate identity of the various member organizations, yet, at the same time, provide the means for an integrated program encompassing the total membership. On completion, this building will be the first community facility in North America to combine the visual and performing arts with the sciences." This iteration featured a folded roof similar to the one used for MSP Airport (1958-62). An earlier version, published in The Minneapolis Star on April 29, 1961 featured a concrete waffle slab on a larger scale than Rapson used on the State Capitol Credit Union (1963-64). The sketch submitted to P/A was published in a March 29, 1962 issue of The Minneapolis Star in an article describing the design process as "rushed"--it appears confusion reigned because a follow-up sketch on April 5 showed the previous waffle slab design. As the P/A award submissions were submitted the prior year, it is unclear which design came first. By January 13, 1963, a sketch of the built design was shared in The Minneapolis Star, credited to Ellerbe & Co. without any mention of Rapson in the accompanying article. Soon after, Rapson was quietly dumped from the project. Ralph Burgard, executive director of the St. Paul Council of Arts and Sciences explained Rapson was jettisoned for space considerations and cost, and Ellerbe\'s ultimate design provided 50% more space (though it was not clear if they asked Rapson to increase the space in his design). Ellerbe\'s design was far less adventurous than Rapson\'s: clad in Indiana limestone on a base of Minnesota granite, the stoic 2-story structure separates its wings with a block-long concourse entered from a small plaza. The north side of the concourse was designed with a 400-seat open-stage theater and a 300-seat multipurpose auditorium; the south side houses the Art Center on a lower level (with a sculpture court behind it) and a science museum above it. Its opening was greeted by pickets by architecture students from the University of Minnesota, denouncing the design with signs reading "Mausoleum or museum?" "St. Paulites have been cheated" and "A $3,000,000 basement." Their consensus was the Ellerbe\'s design was dismal and "doesn\'t reflect the excitement of arts and sciences, as such. It could have been something better than it is." Rapson didn\'t hesitate to share his thoughts on the ultimate design in a May 13, 1965 interview with The Minneapolis Star (around his career and election as a FAIA), deriding it as "a lousy job." The property had previously held the Second Minnesota State Capitol until 1907 (demolished in \'37). The planning for the building began in 1953, when St. Paul voters approved a $1,700,000 bond for its construction; add\'l donations covered a total cost of $2,235,000 projected when construction began in 1963. 1980 add\'n for Science Museum.

The baptismal font is mirror-finished with gentle curves. Total cost: $336,211.92 Design: Eliel Saarinen (1873-1950); Associated architects: Hills, Gilbertson & Hayes (Victor Gilbertson); Sculptured stone panels (1949, front of church) by William M. McVey (who taught at Cranbrook Academy of Art where Eliel was president); Builder: Kraus-Anderson, Inc. The decision to go with a modern design was primarily for economic reasons; the congregation (founded in 1911) initially envisioned a Gothic Revival design, but the Great Depression and World War II made that unaffordable. The Reverend William A. Buege approached Eliel Saarinen desiring what he hoped would be "an honest church." The design was immediately lauded. In assessing outstanding examples of contemporary architecture for the Minneapolis Tribune (10/19/1958), Donald R. Torbert, Associate Prof. of Art at the University of Minnesota, called the church "the most \'honest\' and consistent postwar building in the state. The interior is perfect in its functional design, use of materials, sense of spaciousness and its serene mood. The attention is subtly directed to the most essential features of the building, while every stick and stone in it has its structural purpose as well as its own beauty," further noting the pattern of brickwork was for acoustical purposes, not mere embellishment. In awarding it the 25-year Award, the AIA jury [FAIAs Ralph Rapson (chair), Max Brooks, Robert L. Durham, Huson Jackson, FAIA, and student Kyle T. Hallsteen] "called the church\'s \'architectonic character\' its greatest value. Structural, acoustical and mechanical elements are \'integrated into the form with no compromise. Few examples of religious architecture illustrate this attribute so well. The asymmetrical quality of the plan challenged conventional expectations, setting up a balance of the practical and the esthetic which carries through the entire structure.\'" Architectural historian Rolf T. Anderson noted "In Christ Church Lutheran, through his adept use of materials, proportion, and light, he created a building with great dramatic effect and architectural impact, yet one that also retained a human scale and possessed a feeling of serenity and repose, qualities that distinguished Saarinen’s work from that of many of his fellow modernists. Upon its completion, the church received high acclaim and became an immediate icon of modernism. The building’s warmth and humanity, and, not inconsequentially, affordable design, provided an average congregation in the United States with an appealing alternative to traditional church architecture." The use of plastic fabric to screen the pipe organ was noted in the products section of the January 1951 issue of Architectural Record: Lumite woven Saran fabric, in a light tan honeycomb weave, was implemented to cover the organ pipe section and extend beyond to form a wall (2 such screens were used); the product claimed to give good lone quality and clean easily as it would not need to be removed first; the lower part of each screen consists of flush oak paneling with access panels at either end to allow entrance for servicing the organ. Eliel\'s son, Eero Saarinen (1910-1961), designed a noted 1961-62 Education Wing, connected by an arcade and interior hallways, with gymnasium buried into the ground to maintain a low horizontal roof line (supervising architect for add\'n: Glen Paulsen). Eero took the commission to intentionally keep the new addition subordinate and complementary to his father\'s work. The U.S. National Park Service, under Department of the Interior, listed it on the National Register of Historic Places on June 20, 2001; designated a National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009. In designating it as a Landmark, it was noted for holding "national significance as one of the most celebrated works by Eliel Saarinen, who was among the nation\'s most acclaimed architects and architectural educators of the 20th century. Saarinen was on the leading edge of the modernist movement and played a pivotal role in the emergence of modernist religious architecture in the United States. Through his adept use of materials, proportion, scale, and light, Saarinen created the Christ Church Lutheran building with great dramatic effect and architectural impact, yet one that also retained a human scale and possessed a feeling of serenity and repose--these qualities distinguished Saarinen\'s work from that of many of his fellow modernists. Eliel\'s son, Eero Saarinen, directed design of the 1962 Education Wing addition and completed Saarinen Sr.\'s original design concept." This is one of two American churches designed by Eliel Saarinen; the other, the 1942 First Christian Church in Columbus, Indiana (also a National Historic Landmark), is a larger structure that Eliel used as a model. In a macabre coincidence: The church and its addition were the final works for father and son before their respective deaths in 1950 and 1961; it is the only building where the work of father and son can be seen side-by-side. A major restoration was conducted by MacDonald & Mack Architects (Principal in Charge: Angela Wolf Scott), with some funding from the National Park Service\'s Save America\'s Treasures initiative, requiring construction documents to be reviewed and approved by the State Historic Preservation Office and the National Park Service; in particular, the bell tower (restored 2011) was deteriorating due to rust occurring in the metal reinforcement (which expanded, damaging the adjacent masonry); other work included accessibility upgrades, structural repairs, courtyard and landscape restoration, roof repairs, masonry and hardware restoration, stormwater management and waterproofing, restoration of the organ screen and baptismal font.

The $2.5M structure was designed to house entire departments on single floors, maximizing efficiency for the company. Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Company (Minnesota Mutual) retained Ellerbe in 1950; the original plan (shown in September 1950) was for a 5-story addition to the existing building (in a style reminiscent of the eventual building), this was soon scrapped in favor of a stand-alone building; after acquiring Victory Square (which held the old Saint Paul City Hall and Ramsey County Courthouse until they were demolished in 1933), the revised design presented in August 1953 was the final design as built (1953-55); the building sketch appeared on the Minnesota Mutual Company Seal beginning in 1954. Skyways were added later, including one that punctures the otherwise tidy street façade by the main entrance. The next significant modern building in downtown St Paul would be the YWCA (1959-60). Running out of room, Minnesota Mutual operated in the building until 1982, when it moved to a new headquarters elsewhere in downtown St. Paul (and eventually renamed itself the Securian Financial Group). The building was sold to EcoLab, which used it for a year before selling it to the St. Paul Pioneer Press newspaper (moved in, 1984), which led to 30 years of it being referred to as the “Pioneer Press Building” until the paper moved out in 2015.

In assessing outstanding examples of contemporary architecture for the Minneapolis Tribune (10/19/1958), Donald R. Torbert, Associate Prof. of Art at the University of Minnesota, admired its particularly effective exterior in a modern interpretation of Byzantine design. The four-story tall Greek cross is topped with a golden dome (constructed of anodized aluminum), creating a landmark above Lake Bde Maka Ska. The $800,000 complex includes the airy glass and buff brick church, auditorium-gymnasium with seating for 700, and education wing for 220 children, outdoor worship center, fellowship lounge, library, offices; the nave was initially designed with a capacity of 655, with overflow facilities for 1,000. Many of the tall, brick walls of the sanctuary include a grid of small glass windows that add natural light, adding to the airiness and spirituality of the sacred space. The congregation considered the site "nearly perfect" because the prescribed Eastern orientation for Orthodox churches could not accommodate a front entry from the street (which they deemed a minor matter in the overall beauty of the property); in Eastern Orthodox church architecture, the altar (sanctuary) is always situated in the eastern part of the church, regardless of its shape. The original layout was in a T-shape, with an open courtyard at the intersection formed by the 3 wings (courtyard still extant). The south wing was designed for the school facilities, administration unit, priest\'s office, a secretarial-reception area, and library; the north wing housed kitchen, stage facilities to serve the auditorium/banquet hall, fellowship lounge, and in the northwest corner a half-story basement apartment for the sexton\'s quarters. The original built structure included a small chapel at the back of the nave on the northwest, intended for baptisms and small weddings. On the opposite southwest corner is an enclosed infant\'s room with sound-system, together with a glass-paned east wall enabling its users to follow the services visually and aurally. The east end of the nave, on either side of the altar, are the choir room (south) and a sacristy and confessional (north). Stained glass windows from the old church were installed in the new church in 1960. Interior iconography is by Demetrios J. Dukas (d.2011), preeminent iconographer who had previously done restoration work on Istanbul\'s Hagia Sophia and later painted the icons of the St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Washington, DC; in 1993, Dukas returned to add four Evangelists around the Christ Pantocrator, the central dome icon that dominates the entire scheme of the interior iconography. Outside, the square Stone Altar was assembled in 1956, as the church was being completed: Originally on the same level as the courtyard, it was moved to a lower level (at the bottom of stairs from the courtyard) once the school wing was expanded with a second, lower story; imbedded in the surface are four stones representing the story of the Christian Faith as the Greek Church enters its history. A fountain in the middle of the courtyard (outside the exo-narthex) was added in 1959; atop it is the sculpture, Palindrome (1976) by Paul Granlund, depicting two aspects of the person: a maiden kneeling (bringing water to her face) and as a figure in flight (having washed away her iniquities and set free, cleansed on sin). The structure\'s design is credited to John G. Rauma, then-Chief Design Consultant of Thorshov & Cerny (principal Roy Thorshov was proud of the building); Rauma had designed the aforementioned American Hardware Mutual Building for the firm, then joined Robert Cerny with the firm split in 1960 and the latter formed The Cerny Associates.; he left to form Griswold & Rauma in 1963 (which designed the Sunday School add\'n in 1964). Builder: C.H. Peterson Construction Co. Featured as a notable church ahead of the 1960 national conference (in the Twin Cities) of the Church Architectural Guild of America & the Department of Church Building and Architecture of the National Council of Churches of Christ and published in the March-April 1960 issue of Northwest Architect (conference theme "The Modern Church: its Message and its Architectural Challenge"); local architect Gordon A. Schlichting, of Armstrong & Schlichting, was Assistant General Chairman of the conference and noted Minnesota was considered at the time to be "the cradle of the birth of contemporary church architecture in these United States." 1964 one-story classroom add\'n (181\'x87\'x10) to the west of the original educational wing was designed by Griswold & Rauma (Builder: George Madsen Const.), it created a double-wing with a long, narrow courtyard between the two; it added two stories of classrooms facing the lake, a larger library, more offices for the clergy, secretarial office, youth room (with patio) and a lecture room with kitchen facilities at the south end (enclosing the courtyard at the southern end). In September 1957, the Minneapolis Tribune asked distinguished architect and Dean of the University of Minnesota School of Architecture Ralph Rapson to list some of his own favorite examples of contemporary religious architecture; basing his judgment on how the houses of worship answer the needs of their congregations as well as technical aspects, he named Christ Church Lutheran, St. Mary\'s Greek Orthodox, First Christian, Mt. Zion Temple, Temple of Aaron, and predicted the St. John\'s Abbey Church (as designed) was going to be equally notable [his selections have all lasted the test of time]. The location above Lake Bde Maka Ska was the site of a string of landmarks, starting in 1834 with a cabin built by missionary brothers Samuel & Gideon Pond on a site selected by Mdewakanton Dakota chief Cloud Man near his village of Heyate Otunwe (the Pond cabin was the first structure built by Europeans in the limits of what is now Minneapolis; it lasted 5yrs before the Ponds moved to Lake Harriett). The site was subsequently home to landmarks Pavilion (1877), converted to the Lyndale Hotel (burned), and the 20-room Frank B. Forman Mansion (1900. Ms. Forman died in 1949 and the site became available). The Forman estate originally sold the extensive property in 1954 to the Northwestern National Life Insurance Company, which planned to build a new headquarters on the site (similar to the American Hardware Mutual Building, built at the north side of the lake in 1954-55, also designed by Thorshov & Cerny); resistance to the project by the residential neighborhood led the insurance company to subdivide and sell the property (it would go on to build a landmark in the Gateway Center with Minoru Yamasaki). Meanwhile, in the Midtown neighborhood, St. Mary\'s Greek Orthodox Church was making plans to replace their existing Byzantine Revival church (built 1909) at Lake St & 10th with a new, $250,000 church. The original replacement plan, as unveiled in February 1954, was to demolish the 250-seat church and build a larger 730-person church on the same site; the church was to be connected to the existing school building by a covered walkway and share a combined entrance for the two buildings around a square Roman garden; this replacement plan (with the church following a Latin cross orientation) was to be designed by Liebenberg and Kaplan. When Northwestern National Life announced plans to sell the lots above Bde Maka Ska, St. Mary\'s Greek Orthodox purchased the largest lot at the north to build a new complex. The shift in plans was announced by December 1954, and Minnesota Governor Orville Freeman spoke at the launch of its expanded fund drive in January 1955: plans were for a $300,000 000 "neo-Byzantine type church--a combination auditorium-gymnasium and educational building--on a new location." To generate the additional capital needed for the more ambitious plan, the congregation knocked down its own church in June 1955 while developing the pack of the site into a grocery store (1010 Lake St E) that it immediately leased to the National Tea Co. (the original church site became the parking lot for the grocery store). The church temporarily moved services to the Marcy-Holmes neighborhood as the new church was constructed. By the July 1956 groundbreaking, the budget was estimated at $800,000. The cornerstone was laid on September 9, 1956 by Bishop Ezekiel, Chicago-based leader of the Greek Orthodox churches in the Middle West. The congregation began worshiping in the completed auditorium in February 1957, with the sanctuary completed in April 1957. The consecration ceremony and "thyroanixia" (the "door opening") took place on May 6th/7th, 1961. At the NE is a substantial, 2001 event center addition by Chris Kamagais.'),

The curtain wall had a U-factor (rate of heat transfer through a product) of .241 and consisted of porcelain enamel on aluminum, on both faces, with a special cement-asbestos core; they were integrally locked with a neoprene gasket into the slender aluminum, vertical mullions with no horizontal aluminum grid members, only the gasketing separates them vertically. The June \'57 article resulted in many reader responses the P/A editors described as running the gamut from "queries, protests, and from one reader a frank \'I don\'t believe it,\' following a report of the remarkable 5/\'16"\'-thick laminated panel" so Dinkeloo responded in the September 1957 issue with thermal transmission tests run by an independent testing lab; Kaiser Aluminum ran a 2-page ad in the November 1958 issue of P/A, noting (in add\'n to the U-factor) that the porcelain enameled aluminum alloy sheets (used outside and inside) were intended to provide permanent color, matte finish; the outside face is patterned in two hues of blue, with the inside a solid tint of pale blue; the spandrel panels and fixed windows are integrally joined to aluminum mullions and horizontal members by means of continuous-mold neoprene gaskets ("A \'zipper\' spline on gasket functions as a locking device") to eliminate all through-metal fasteners and need for weatherproofing sealants; original section totaled 588,000 sq ft, it was designed to be expandable an almost modular design, and indeed received a great many additions. Featured in the November 1960 issue of the Journal of the American Institute of Architects in a AIA Building Type Reference Guide on Industrial Buildings; it noted how the expandable building was thought through: analysis found the company would have structures of 60,000sf for manufacturing and 40,000sf for administration, so the site plan was so "unit pavilions" could grow "laterally from a central core, with the one-story, 250-foot square manufacturing pavilions expanding to the east and the two-story administration and educational pavilions, each 80 by 250 feet expanding to the west." The arrangement was done in a checkerboard pattern to allow intervening garden courts. The central core was designed with dining and recreation areas and a visitor\'s entrance area on the north--the entrance was de-emphasized, with the focus placed on workers (with entrances all being handled equally: visitors, white collar, blue collar). From the core, 2 "spinelike" corridors connect the unit pavilions, which in turn have a corresponding adjacent parking lot. The interior was designed for employee psychology: light and airy with the original machines in a deep blue, while bins for manufactured parts were in 6 very different bright colors and arranged in various combinations.

Vertical steel ribs/fins run the height of the building. Ecolab\'s plans for a downtown headquarters began in 1964; Bergstedt, Wahlberg & Wold were selected in March 1965. Clark Wold was the firm\'s chief architect for this project (he departed the firm in \'68 to form Wold Architects). Because Ecolab\'s business was based on cleaning products, the president (and son of its late founder) Edward Osborn, directed them to "design an office building as modern and handsome as can be found anywhere, one that is flexible, functional and attractive but with the added distinction of cleanability. Build in cleanability as a function of design just as you build in air-conditioning or plumbing. Do it by the selection of materials, the shapes of surfaces; do it by shutting off the outside world with glass and bringing in filtered air; do it by leaving no place for dirt to hide." Thus, the building was designed with many features and material selections aimed to be easy to clean. The plans included exploring a system to have the building clean its own windows using a mechanical device running up and down the face of the building in roller channels provided in the stainless-steel mullion--the plan for such cleaning features drew notice from Progressive Architecture (then the biggest magazine on modernism) in July 1968. The original, 1966 plan was for a phased design starting with a 13-story tower (on top of the base), expandable for up to 7 more floors; as soon as the steel framework for the first 13 was completed, EcoLab added seven additional stories (adding $3M to the original price). Hammel, Green & Abrahamson designed the plaza. Larry Millet, Twin Cities expert who served as architecture critic of Pioneer Press, noted the building is considered "the finest midcentury office structure in downtown St. Paul" and "has an especially elegant glass-walled lobby reminiscent of the work of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe." Received a design award in 1969 from the Minnesota State Arts Council for "the commendable tone of artistic, clean functionalism set a standard for the construction of other exceptional buildings in the area." the building was a major part of the Capitol Centre urban redevelopment area, started by St. Paul\'s Housing Redevelopment Authority (HRA) in the 1950s in conjunction with the Architects\' Counseling Committee (consisting of 4 firms: Cavin & Page, Cerny Assoc., Grover Dimond Assoc., and Haarstick, Lundgren & Assoc.) on a planned 12-block area, with a skyway system developed by Hammel, Green & Abrahamson; in 1965, plans were released for a major, $26.8M 3-block development, planned by Davidson-Baker Company in conjunction with Grover Dimond Associates, including this block as well as the two to the immediate east (now anchored by the Northwestern National Bank and American National Bank buildings)--Ecolab\'s headquarters became the first building planned for the development. The east entrance built after the Northwestern Telephone Exchange Company Building (1912) was razed in 1969 and the base was extended to include the newly available area on the block; a large, welded steel sculpture "Above, Above" (1972, Alexander Liberman) was in the newly created plaza until its removal in 2017; a reflecting pool around the perimeter of the tower (with fountains) was disabled and filled with plantings. The 15-story Capital Centre Building (1973) was built sharing the same plaza, connected by a one-story aluminum and glass walkway addition; plaza was renovated in the 1990s.

The project was planned before WW2, but was delayed by the war and finding funding appropriations. The final plan is a crisply designed brick building with parts carefully delineated, much like Prudential Building of same period (designed by Magney, Tusler & Setter); includes Mayo Meditation Chapel, three-story-high octagonal space with tall, narrow stained-glass windows. The $12M structure was for medical care and research, and was named in honor of Drs. Charles & William Mayo (founders of Rochester\'s Mayo Clinic who both died in 1939). At the time of completion, it towered over the rest of the campus and linked the university\'s hospital and medical school buildings to give it one of the world\'s largest medical centers "under one roof." The Minnesota Legislature created a committee, under former Carleton College president Donald J. Cowling, to consider plans for a memorial to the Mayo brothers; the committee decided the most fitting memorial would be a medical research center in the middle of the university\'s medical quadrangle. The designs initially presented by Clarence H. Johnston, Jr. in 1944 were of a 12-story building in the more traditional, reserved architectural style between Art Deco and the restrained Classical Style found in other campus buildings of the 1930s and 1940s; the location was to be in approximately in the same location, blending closer with the buildings flanking it. This initial iteration was smaller, with an estimated price tag of $2M. The plan soon ballooned in scope, and the proposal was for up-to a 22-story tower as excavations and caisson footings began in 1950 (Builder: C.F. Haglin Co.). The complications of the Korean War raised construction costs significantly, causing construction to halt. The Minnesota Legislature refused to adequately fund the larger design, so the building plan was slashed down to 12-14 stories (ultimately 14, plus 2 for service equipment) in May 1951. The $11M+ permit for the main, steel structure for a 14-story building was filed in September 1951, Clarence H. Johnston, Jr. architect, with combined builders Madsen Const. Co. & Steenberg Const. Co.  Funding for the entire ~$12M project came from roughly $7M from the state legislature, $2M from private citizens, $2M from the federal government, and the rest from various groups. A diagram in a feature of the October 17, 1954 Minneapolis Tribune outlined the initial layout (8 tower floors, plus attic, on top of a base of 6 larger floors, with wings connecting them to the existing hospital and medical school buildings), from bottom to top: the first two, partially underground floors included garage for over 275 cars, animal quarters, locker rooms, laboratories, and bookkeeping; the 3rd floor (on the main quad) had the main entrance, main offices, departments of medicine and dermatology, and outpatient department of psychiatry and neurology; the 4th floor held operating rooms, as well as some hospital beds (and connected to the auditorium section); the 5th floor held hospital beds, the department of cystoscopy (urology) as well as the observation rooms for the four operating theaters; the 6th floor also had beds, offices, as well as the in-patient departments of psychiatry, as well as ENTs. The upper floors were departments of bacteriology, physical medicine, pediatrics, as well as medical school administration and the School of Public Health. A separate 550-seat auditorium section, with conical footprint, cut across Delaware street at the north end; the lower level was a lecture hall, middle level (connected by skyway) the main auditorium, with a balcony level above.

Flexibility was achieved by modular design, permitting complete flexibility in laboratory area installations with ready access to water, steam, gas, air, etc. supplied at regular intervals. The modular design was evidenced on the exterior, as the mullions between windows were centered on modular lines of 3\'8" from center-to-center. The interior partitions, overhead suspension hangers and in-well tension strips for apparatus suspensions or installations were also spaced accordingly. Piping in manifold systems with branch plug openings spaced every 4th module (14\'8"). Piping and ductwork were designed for removal or augmentation without structural changes, color-identified throughout, and left exposed. The structural weight is carried on concrete columns and steel mullions in the exterior walls, with all interior partitions non-load-bearing and easily removed or rearranged to meet space requirements. The building is designed around a central "unit operations core" extending from the 3rd floor unit operations laboratory up to the top of the penthouse; the central core was designed for alternative designs as needed for research. Safety by laboratory placement, ventilation, and flash-proof partitions. The most experimental laboratories were placed on the top floor, the architects considered the location for those advantageous for safety: "in the event of an explosion, only the top floors would suffer." Furthermore, the traffic would be kept be managed by keeping undergraduate classrooms on the lower floors. The wide expanse of windows were intended for both natural ventilation and "blow-out" protection: an explosion would force the glass outward, preventing structural damage and minimizing injuries to staff. Each lab possessed forced exhaust hood ventilators and safety showers.

Major terminal project commissioned by the Minneapolis-Saint Paul Metropolitan Airports Commission to modernize Wold-Chamberlain Field (better known as Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport or MSP); designed as the beginning of a new "terminal city" planned for expansion as needed (parking garage with car rental facilities, hotel, etc) and an initial anticipated traffic of 30,000 daily passengers; the architects planned a complete air-terminal structure in the first-stage, so expansion could be easy and economical; the initial design was for 20 gates with easy expansion "to an eventual 39 positions." A multi-level terminal with one-way access roads leading to each level (via ramps) with covered outdoor unloading areas; the original design concept is still in use; early sketches shown in P/A show a version of the iconic folded roof that was more of a traditional accordion roof (coming up to pointed fold), the main terminal was flanked by observation decks that were eventually replaced by new terminals. An early sketch indicated a potential future hotel addition would rise from the folded roof and float over it. Ground was broken for the $8.5M, 600,000sf terminal in October 1958; it opened in January 1962; the 1957 sketch of the main terminal concourse and its ceramic tile pattern on both floors and some walls was featured in a March 1961 ad for the Tile Council of America (in P/A). Featured as part of a technical article on Airports (AIA Building Type Reference Guide, BTRG 7-4*) in the May 1961 issue of the Journal of the American Institute of Architects, while in the "last seven months of a five-year development program representing the major portion of $54 million in capital improvements undertaken by the cities\' Airport Commission." Given a 7-page feature in the April 1963 issue of P/A, emphasizing the expandability of the design, based on an annual volume of 1,750,000 passengers which was expected to grow to 4,000,000 within 10 years (by 2019 it served close to 40,000,000 passengers). This need for planned expansion led to a "constant cross-section" scheme for the central building, allowing it to be extended in increments of 30ft bays while remaining visually complete at every stage (it was originally only as wide as the folded-plate concrete roof). It implements a 2-level circulation scheme to eliminate interference between passenger and baggage circulation and also to allow enough automobile platform space for the anticipated volume of traffic. It originally used basement parking and car rental facilities to allow passengers and park and board without being exposed to weather. The initial 2 concourses (originally called "fingers") were built behind the main terminal and were designed for the addition of jetways (no airline had plans to use them at opening). The main floor of the central terminal used "building within a building" construction: single open space with 3 free-standing, 2-story structures within it, for increased programmability: the exposed steel framework of the mezzanines could be altered or removed without affecting the basic structure. Particular note was made of the "folded-plate concrete roof, which creates the directional quality and the identity between front and rear faces that one expects of a gateway." The roof design was picked for being a "relatively economical, fireproof means of spanning the 30\'x 120\' bays; it permits the development of mezzanine spaces and has considerable visual impact. Roofing of white plastic and marble chips has been used to maintain the visual effect of the structure when seen from the air."

Featured in the March-April 1960 issue of Northwest Architect (NWA), which described it as a "product of thoughtful experience" that was "first of all, a home tempered to the personalities of its inhabitants." NWA noted the exterior confirmed with the neighboring houses in an "architecturally acceptable" of size, height, setback, and simplicity of material; it complimented the unique value placed on form, composition, and architectural experience: "The exterior of the home is, as it should be, an indication of the charm and unusual planning of the interior." On the interior, NWA commented "Using unity and order as the fundamental basis of his design, Mr. Gingold has achieved a feeling of unconfined space through the dominance of the two-story living room with its tall central windows and fireplace on a central axis, visible from four primary activity areas—the entry, sitting room, dining room and kitchen. All the rooms in the house open onto this central room. From any part of the room, as one passes through it, the space is continually changing in height and horizontal extension." The entrance driveway and walls are rough cut Mendota bluestone. The house is four levels above the tuck-under garage. Gingold took some of the ideas he learned while traveling Greece (where he eventually retired to before moving to England). Gingold himself was briefly profiled in Progressive Architecture magazine (P/A, then the biggest magazine on modernism) in April 1961 for his unique side gig of working as a motorcycle policeman (using his own motorcycle) while also practicing architecture (his own practice since 1955) and also teaching at the University of Minnesota School of Architecture, the house was described as a "romantic stucco house with the sexiest bathroom in the Midwest." It was then subject of a (almost bemused) feature in the May 1962 issue of P/A, which noted "In fact, few of the houses here convey as much of the personality of their architects as does this one. Gingold is a man of many talents and interests and his house reflects it." Gingold\'s own program for the steep hilly property was to design a house with spaces to lend an "aura of spacious elegance in an abstract and interesting form." In critique, P/A noted "That his architecture is not altogether of a piece is mildly regrettable, but that it has vitality, humor, and imagination is undeniable. Architecturally, one questions the duality of exterior versus interior design. It appears almost as though one architect had developed the outside, and another the inside. Though Gingold states that he designed the exterior in deference to neighboring houses, it seems that the building would be much more at home among neighbors of the Weissenhof Siedlung, the first large-scale permanent exhibit of modern architecture in the Germany of the 1920\'s. However, this rather self-conscious early Bauhaus approach applies only to the exterior. Inside, the architect comes into his own. Here, Gingold\'s exuberance finds full expression. He reveals himself not only as an imaginative sculptor and stage designer but also as a man possessing a fine sense of humor. As sculptor, he realizes that \'the possibilities for sculptural design in space, created with stucco over wood frame, are endless.\' He designed a stair rail which \'winds like the peel of an orange from top to bottom.\' And another plastic element, the fireplace in the form of the \'circle within the cube,\' has become the symbolic center of the building." Organizing the building vertically, he wanted to not only adapt to the hillside but also interpret all 3 dimensions, with a conscious entry sequence from street level to the interior for the house (with a finding flagstone approach along the exterior to the front door) will using tight spaces (stairs) against open spaces--the latter serving as "terminal areas" as an "important punctuation in his spatial sequence." The master bath drew compliments, as P/A felt he designed it "as a cozy living room with tiled seating, books, art objects, a telephone, and even a secret window which gives onto a fireplace on the upstairs gallery and from which he can survey most of the activities throughout the house." The house is topped with a roof deck. In summary, P/A noted "That the end result is more of a stage-set than a house, in the commonly accepted sense of the word, is not surprising. But where else could the architect have made such unhampered use of his talents than in his own house?" Concrete block foundations; Western wood frame; stucco exterior in deference to neighborhood architecture; plaster and stud partitions inside. Primary materials: Cement stucco, white sand-finished plaster and, in contrast, dark-stained mahogany for wall paneling and trim; flooring in dining area and kitchen of Walnut Travertine, a marble quarried in Tuscany, elsewhere wood parquet. Gingold disliked knobs, so cabinets were designed to open to the touch (the main door also eschews nobs). The Gingolds instructed works to not make perfect corners but "allow your hand to caress the cement" to form curving balcony and staircase forms. Gingold only lived in the house for two years before a divorce from his first wife, Sally, forced its sale; the second owner was Pat Nolan, art director at Campbell-Mithun; in 1970 it was sold to Fred & Bouky Labhard (Fred was Swiss-American who moved to work for Toro, Bouky was a Greek who studied architecture in Switzerland), the couple took great care of the house (Fred died in 1986, age 51) and finished the lower level, creating a mahogany-paneled family room/bedroom with two Murphy bends, a small office, and a bathroom. In the 1980s, the estranged Gingolds visited the house together and approved the updates. When Bouky listed in 2017 it was in great shape; the Star Tribune did a feature on it. '),

Lang',E'1964-66',E'Unique home (also known as the "Arch House"), designed by its engineer-owner with an elliptic paraboloid roof. Keith M. Lang (d. 2013) was a mechanical engineer with Honeywell and General Mills (in their High Altitude Balloon program); he came up with the design from 1961-62 without assistance from an architect, contractor, or designer, and obtained a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Experimental loan in 1963 to start building it. "Built like an airplane wing," the curved, stress-skinned roof appears to flex in the center, pushing edges down and creating a dome-like interior; the north and south roof edges curve down toward the ground where they are pinned by concrete anchors. The anchors are covered with triangular plywood shapes that extend the roofline to the ground. The "thin shell" roof is comprised of light weight composite roof materials that are curved to resist both tensile and compressive forces. Fiberglass forms the sheathing of the roof and polyethylene insulation protected by a fabric skin stretched over the surface protects the building. Steel columns 5.5" in size are located along the interior walls and support the load of the roof structure, leaving the interior space free of supporting columns. The exterior walls are brick veneer with picture windows. The interior allows open planning (most of the internal walls do not go all the way up to the ceiling). In the center of the roof is a square skylight of plexiglass double-dome; the second bedroom is an internal room at the center, under the skylight. The interior ceiling was covered in acoustic dampening materials. The foundation is a floating, one-piece concrete slab. Builder: Hugh Thorson Const. Co.; Consulting architect: Wallace Drake (interiors). The original idea came to Lang in 1956, while he was in California; by 1958 he saw material technology had made it so such a design might work in the Minnesota climate. Lang knew the cost of such an experimental house was likely outside of his means, so he began looking for sponsor to provide most of the building materials, with the understanding that the house would be featured on display to person in both the building trades and the public. Before he obtained the $25,000 FHA guarantee he had 15 sponsors and 25 manufacturers of chemicals, plastics, plywood, appliances and other materials collaborating on the project. He received consultation from foreman and experimental technician Charles Probst, and Wallace Drake of Ellerbe Architects assisted with interior plans. Meanwhile, JFK\'s New Frontier policy (beginning in 1961) streamlined the New Deal-era FHA, amending the relevant act to make possible guarantees to "foster the advancement of new designs, materials and techniques which may reduce costs, raise living standards and improve neighborhood housing" (previously the FHA gave loans only on "conventional" home construction). It was the first house in the Upper Midwest to receive money through the "Section 233" Experimental Housing Program. As part of the arrangement, the Langs agreed to live in the house and allow experiments to be conducted and reported on during a 5-year period (covering aspects of heat loss, cooling and heating costs, stress and deflection measurements of the roof under experimental load, interior noise, overall-performance of materials, techniques, and equipment). The lot was selected for its view of Shady Oak Lake. Construction was delayed until Spring 1964 due to a neighborhood issue with planning the cul-de-sac, and a need for warmer weather to work with walls that used plastic. Though not a civil or structural engineer, Lang\'s work both in California at Northrop Aircraft and in the Twin Cities gave him understanding of aircraft design and aeronautics, which in turn may have also lent to the inspiration. The house went on display in September 1966 (with many casual gawkers coming by to see it beforehand), it was touted as "The Dramatically Difference Arch-House: The most significant home to be built in the Twin Cities in two decades." Tradespeople were allowed in from September 14-17, and the public from September 18 to October 9, 1966. A 200-square-foot detached garage, designed in 1962 but not built until 1972, is located to the north of the house (originally planned to use a similar roof design, it uses a more conventional approach to construction). Minnesota\'s State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) office recommended the Lang House as eligible for the National Register under "Criterion C: Architecture" for its distinctive characteristics of type, period, and method of construction when the building reaches 50 years of age when it was catalogued during the planning of the Southwest Light Rail line which would pass on an adjacent right-of-way.

Torbert, Associate Prof. of Art at the University of Minnesota, compared it against Saarinen\'s Christ Lutheran: "Where Christ Lutheran enfolds its congregation and closes out the world, St. Peter\'s is open to the sky. It is a beautifully-balanced, light and airy structure in which, again, every element has its purpose." The windowed dome\'s huge triangular windows flood the center altar and nave with natural light during the daytime and moon and starlight at night. The decision to place the altar at the center combined modern architecture with the worship customs of early Christians; seven rows of pews form a circle around the marble altar. Directly behind the altar and in front of the organ console is the pulpit. The $290,000 church\'s design received additional consultation from Chicago-based pastor and church design/symbolism authority Dr. A. R.

Family requirements, while fairly normal, did require that adult and children\'s living be separated and that all major rooms take advantage of lake view.

A play-recreation room, four children\'s bedrooms with bath, a maid\'s room, a two-car garage, large storage facilities were also required.

A closer look at the plans show the house to be composed of square bays which have been manipulated to furnish a good deal of variety in the room shapes, while imposing a subtle discipline on the proportions. The consciousness of this module is reassuring because it gives unity, yet space is not confined but developed continuously.

Small house as the summer "cottage" of a wealthy wife of a successful Wisconsin businessman, Ian C. Poole; she was a painter and he had little interest in visiting (the couple had no children), so the design met her two programmatic requirements of a studio and a garage with space for her white Thunderbird. Per the architects, the house was designed to be "simple to operate, relatively maintenance free and to take advantage of a fine view" from its gently rolling, wooded site over Lotus Lake. The architects noted "The one-level plan was developed to take advantage of view. Concrete slab was on grade, central area finished with integral black coloring and aluminum dividing strips. Bath tiled with aqua ceramic tile, other areas wall-to-wall carpeted. Concrete brick cavity walls, painted white, had insulation in cavity. Some \'Cemesto\' panel walls and large areas of insulating glass were used. Steel architectural projection-type operating sash. All doors flush wood, 8\'-6" high to ceiling. Plastic sky domes over control area and bath. Roof wood framed with built up roofing and sand finish plaster." The house sits of a 40\'x60\' footprint and has floor-to-ceiling windows in almost every room, bringing in natural light and blurring the indoor/outdoor relationship—though this ran into some of the technical limits of what constituted "insulated" glass in the late-1950s (more on that below). The floorplan is bisected by a central corridor and a perpendicular breezeway that split the plan into four unequally-sized parted. The structure is oriented around a tree outside the entry door. Builder: H.H. Lunde; Construction costs (structure only): $24,500 (2023: ~$256,000). The 1960 AIA MN jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C. Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "The general feeling of warmth and the careful choice of materials is especially commendable in this house. The central gallery which penetrates the entire house seems an elegant and dramatic note in such a small house and certainly would contribute to the spaciousness and to the ease of general circulation. The jury had high praises for the interior spaces and for the quality of the surfaces that form the spaces but they questioned whether the general exterior appearance quite equals the high quality of the interior." Rapson did not expect the house, which was developed/redesigned over several years, to become one of his lasting  works (the 1960 AIA MN Awards also included a higher Merit Award for his Dr. Alan P. & Felicia J. Thal Residence in North Oaks), but circumstances of ownership kept it in excellent condition and the respectful original client allowed him room to authentically express his own design in a clean, compact structure. Elizabeth Margaret (Betty) Poole died in December 1970, age 55. Although Betty\'s husband survived her, her will gave the house to Ralph Rapson; Rapson then sold the house to his associate, Timothy Stone, who negotiated the condition that he could make changes would be in line with the original design and accommodate his family of four. Stone then converted the painting studio into a family room, built a new garage (transforming the original one-car garage into a bedroom) and enclosed part of the breezeway. The house, now at 2,000sf, was still small for the Stone family who sold it in the late 1970s to a Dutch couple, Peter and Hermine Lustig, that kept the house mostly as-is but for some minor aesthetic additions from Peter\'s work as an artist. The Lustigs kept in contact with Rapson, and had him vet the next buyer in 2003. The changes present in the 2015 iteration include wood paneling in the family room, the terrazzo floors in the dining area, and a tiled sunken tub in the bathroom. '),

A distinguished panel of Twin Cities architects gathered by The Minneapolis Star in 1976 (Robert Cerny, Curtis H. Green, Thomas H. Hodne, Leonard Parker, and Ralph Rapson) all put IDS Center as one of their "10 Best" buildings in Minneapolis. The complex is best known for the Crystal Court (forming the base between the 4 structures) and the enormous main tower, where Johnson employed distinctive zigzag cuts in the tower\'s corners (which he called "zogs") to break the mirror effect "into a thousand refractions." Johnson further created what he deemed a "cage-like visual effect" by making the exterior dark gray anodized aluminum in solid structural bands and hairline-thin horizontal and vertical strips. It was Johnson\'s largest work at the time. The development process was an open secret, due to all the negotiations required to obtain the entire city block as the company acquired and demolished buildings (including via trades of properties in downtown): A model was shown to city officials in Spring 1968, however directors of IDS delayed officially announcing the project. The only reason they revealed the plan on February 5, 1969 was to obtain permits required to build 4 Skyways. Early statements noted it was planned to be over 50-stories (final height 57) completely surpassing the previous tallest building in Minneapolis, the 37-story Foshay Tower. Johnson felt Minneapolis led the nation in the concept of a second-level city, and built that concept into the heart of IDS Center; he felt the skyways, in addition to breaking up the grid of streets and keeping pedestrians away from traffic, provided aesthetic accents comparable to European "churches and plazas" and Venetian canals: "The bridges act as frames for the vistas up and down the street." Ever the showman, Johnson stated in 1969 "I don\'t care if the skyway leads to hell. I don\'t care about Dayton\'s [next door]. The skyway gives character to the town that, except for Venice, can\'t be repeated. The artistic reasons for it at the best ones" and boasted the Crystal Court "will be the most exciting inside court in the country." Johnson wanted baskets of moss hanging from the roof of the Crystal Court, filled with ivy draping down to just above head level, with the court having a permanent flower market, dotted with fountains and sculpture in what he called "a frolic area." The AIA Journal did an in-depth review of Johnson, as a living AIA Gold Medal recipient, in its June 1979 issue; they selected IDS Center as his single work to focus on, likely because Johnson himself viewed it as a major turning point in his career: By the late-1960s, Johnson felt that some viewed his ideas (and himself) as "irrelevant," especially in the art museum scene he had been focusing on; as Johnson noted: "We had very little work at that time. But urban design is a dead end, because nothing gets built—just more piles of paper. I like to build, not just make schemes. I was terribly envious of [I.M.] Pei—Kips Bay, I thought, was a really fine group. I would have been interested in doing that sort of thing, but nobody asked me. That\'s why when we started doing IDS in Minneapolis, it seemed like a brand new world. IDS was the eye-opener for urban statements that could still be connected with the profit system. We could get to the heart of a city—unlike museums—and affect the lives of millions. Naturally, that\'s very heady stuff. And we could make a building that from 100 miles away was a symbol of the town, at the same time that we could make a gathering place like an old fashioned market. It was the turning point of all our work." The issue\'s examination of the project concluded "It would seem that just as Johnson got to Minneapolis at just the right time, Minneapolis got to Johnson at just the right time." Peter Blake (editor in chief of Architectural Forum in 1964-72 and of Architecture Plus in 1972-75) described the building as "a reinterpretation of Mies\' prismatic glass skyscraper projects of 1919 and 1921" in a piece in that same issue. The Architectural Forum (January-February 1973) described the center as "Johnson\'s major completed work to date" and a project "sinking its roots into downtown Minneapolis while its reflective tower symbolized that city\'s emergence. [. . .] IDS functions as successfully from an urbanistic standpoint as any grouping of its size could conceivably be expected to in a city where the average downtown building is less than half its size" noting that the complex entrances "funnel" people to the Crystal Court from both the street level and Skyways, "the space inside the site is, in effect, the central idea [. . .] It is a public place which serves the dual function of providing civic space and enhancing the private spaces of the structures for which it provides a processional entrance" (contrasting it to the opposite result from Boston\'s Prudential Center, which was both isolated from its surroundings and did not contain anything to draw people inside), furthermore it found the Crystal Court "an exciting, dramatic room, full of vertical as well as horizontal movement--the roof, made up of a pile of glass and steel pyramids, mounts towards the southeast corner of the court, reaching 121 feet at its highest point. The slabs of the tower and the hotel are visible through the glass roof, creating an inside-outside tension within the enclosed plaza. The court is ultimately like a great class circus tent pitched in the center of the complex--and while it has the welcome excitement of that kind of space it also has the feeling of lightness of a circus tent, perhaps excessively so for a space that intends to be very much a permanent civic crossroads." The 1975 AIA Jury consisted of Richard Meier, John Desmond, Gertrude Kerbis, Donald E. Olsen, and Alfred Price (student); they agreed that "I.D.S. Center is truly the city center," and were equally impressed by the Crystal Court, noting "This lean-to galleria is by no means the simple greenhouse variety, but a scintillating, crystalline, transparent, multiple reflective ambient; grand but not grandiose, exciting yet sustaining in dignity and interest."

The Crystal Court was featured on the cover of the August 1975 issue of the AIA Journal on "Urban Accomplishments." The Crystal Court was subject of another glowing evaluation in the August 1978 issue of the AIA Journal, contrasted as a lively successful urban space against the comparatively cold, empty plaza of the contemporaneously built Federal Reserve Building: "in human terms of pleasurable environmental and social experiences, there can be no doubt that the Crystal Court of the IDS Center wins hands-down, perhaps even nationwide."

The specific citation stated "Admired as \'one of the best examples to date of the one-story subdivided school for a northern and bitter climate," this school building has large window areas to the south, with sunlight controlled by roof projection, and continuous clerestory on the north to provide bilateral lighting. The Jury also commended the \'fine use of brick.\'" Original design of the one-story, basement-less building was an E-shape floorplan with 3 wings of 6 rooms (14 classrooms, kindergarten, library) branching off a central wing with administrative offices and a large auditorium/multipurpose room; the primary playground was on the north side; a 4th wing, in similar style, was added on the north, boxing in the playground on 3 side. Engineers: Ralph E. Thomas & Assoc., Inc. The school cost $475,000, and was originally designed for 550 pupils. The design also came from the educational philosophy of Richfield school superintendent, H.E. Rumpel, who said the school was built from the inside out: "We built it around the ideas of what we wanted to use it for," under the belief that each teacher wanted to be with their class as much as possible, "indoors and out." It originally featured individual landscaped garden areas for each classroom. Sometimes called Central Elementary School. Progressive Architecture did a deeper dive on the school in July 1950, as part of a series of critiques of elementary schools: it showing the bilateral natural lighting, central corridor using glass-block inserts in a brick cavity wall, kindergarten room with fireplace, the south-facing windows received shade from roof projections above (restricting direct sun to the lower areas of windows) and counter-balanced with window-shade pockets for upward shade adjustment (built into the sill), but these were swapped out at the request of the school board with Venetian blinds; after construction, the architects agreed with the need for refinements such as eliminating the original design element of an exit door from each classroom to its own garden area (Thorshov noted that in actual experience the doors were practically useless "because there is such a short time during the school year in which use can be made of the gardens.").'),

It represents the kind of luxury urban living which is very naturally a product of densely populated cities. This type of living is associated with elegant monumental architecture, with dramatic view and with service and facilities which are not customary in a single-family residence or in the typical three-story walkup apartment building. The apartment units themselves have been conceived in the nature of contemporary \'rambler\' houses." Its curtain wall construction was compared to the U.N. Secretariat Building in Manhattan, with an exterior of glass and masonry over a steel-reinforced poured-concrete frame. The first floor was originally to be sheathed in glazed mosaic tile. The entire first floor and mezzanine were recessed to provide a covered loggia on the four sides of the building. Designed with 160 apartment units, ranging from 900sf one-bedrooms (rending at $220-280 per month) up to 1,500SF 3-bedroom units ($380-470).

This kind of church seems far out to some people, but it\'s a return to basic principles. It is big and it is simple--almost to the point of being primitive. It\'s not nearly so sophisticated as Gothic architecture." Gustavus president Edgar M.

The design, in the words of P/A, " turns its back on the rest of the campus and directs the attention of its occupants inward toward a central court" which was roofed by 4 hyperbolic paraboloid "umbrellas" with clerestory windows between the canopy and surrounding roof; the circulation of the building was designed to flow around and throw the courtyard, which makes a useful gathering and exhibition space; the courtyard is surrounded by a "moat" (opening) to allow light to the basement corridors, as well as a similar moat on the perimeter of the outside of the building providing natural light to below-grade classrooms; the exterior is faced in brick with narrow windows; a smaller hyperbolic-paraboloid canopy stands over the main entrance; structural frame is of reinforced concrete, and the hyperbolic paraboloid roof of the court is completely separated from that of the surrounding building with the clerestory between them incorporates a vertical slip joint; original studies proposed the courtyard be an open landscaped area, but after a study it was found the hyperbolic paraboloid enclosure would only add $50,000. At the time of construction, the School of Architecture only occupied approx. 60% of the building, the rest was given to the burgeoning engineering programs, as such the permit for the 192\'x192\' structure was "two-story & basement reinforced concrete Architectural & Engineering Overflow Building" that included the two-story & basement "Administrative Office Wing connecting the overflow building to the Mechanical Engineering Bldg" (still extant on the south side, with glass and panel curtain walls).

A gigantic wood-beamed roof appears to float over the stucco structure, thanks to a ribbon of clerestory windows ringing the building; the flat, square roof provides deep overhangs. The parish was established as a mission in 1884, this building came together in a moment of crisis: originally planned as a "basement church," the original architects never finished the church building. Father Lawrence Keller, parish pastor in charge of the project, noted the parish was "in deep trouble" and decided "that\'s when you need the best – so I called Ralph Rapson." Thus, Rapson\'s team was handed the program to provide the maximum space for the least amount of money, with seating for approximately 1000, with a small chapel, confessionals, working sacristy, priest and choir sacristies, and a small office – all while keeping what was already there. As the existing basement was not capable of receiving heavy loading, the firm used "an independent roof structural system of 24" found concrete columns 23\' [on center] was used, supporting two double transverse laminated wood beams upon which secondary laminated wood beams of 155\' length rested, with wood purlins and wood decking completing the framing." This design meant the exterior walls were not load-bearing, so they were structured using a steel stud cavity wall frame covered on both interior and exterior surfaces with rough-textured stucco. The firm noted the "solution relies on the vast space enclosure and the direct demonstration of the structural system for its aesthetical and architectural expression. Departing from the usual soaring form that is the stereotyped image for a religious building, the center is an architecture of directness and simplicity – and economy." Rapson was influenced by Le Corbusier\'s Notre-Dame du Haut (1954) in Ronchamp, France. The 1973 jury comprised Robert Gourley, AIA (former Harvard prof. and Cambridge-based architect), Charles Lawrence, FAIA (Houston-based architect), and landscape architect William Johnson (Michigan-based); they commented "It is a very simple, very enticing building . . . An everyday place to worship. All essential elements have been used very quietly. Good architecture." For the 25 Year Award, the Honor Awards Committee\'s Ed Kodet wrote "St. Thomas Aquinas was ahead of its time in terms of meeting the liturgical needs of Vatican II; it would be a fine example of liturgical architecture if it were built today.

The program was for a sanctuary, seminar rooms, lounges, offices and a fellowship hall for a nondenominational congregation to reach out to the community; the congregation wanted "colonial" style buildings expressive of their architectural/religious past. Principle Richard F. Hammel described a 6-year design process; the design, using simple forms, was "symbolic of a Puritan religious heritage." The site was previously ignored for development because of its swampy location within a protected watershed district; the complex attempts to preserve wilderness, which Hammel noted was both a "moral as well as a legal necessity." The design evokes a New England town square using simple forms and wooden construction: originally consisting of 5 gabled volumes of various sizes, connected by flat roof canopied colonnade that becomes an enclosed "main street." The street opens onto a central outdoor court whose focus is a bell tower. The simplicity of the sanctuary echoes a Puritan religious heritage. The exteriors are bleached redwood clapboard siding. The 1980 AIA Jury consisted of Frank Tomsick (chair), Bruce J. Graham, John Graves, Jane Hastings, Thomas H. Hodne, Donald L. Stull, David V.

Colburn: Emotion in Modern Architecture" by Jay Pridmore; Colburn described the house: "Grace and Glory, pomp and circumstance, have been sadly neglected in the current preoccupation with functional design. " Influenced by the layout of a classic Italian villa, Progressive Architecture (P/A, then the biggest magazine on modernism) used this house as an example of a Paladin plan for the wealthy (rather than the style of FLW) in May 1967. Colburn noted "Grace and glory, pomp and circumstance have been sadly neglected in the current preoccupation with functional design. The emotional potential of architecture has been rarely probed in the building of our time. This is a valid area, untouched and exciting."  P/A noted "The massive walls pierced by long narrow windows and the \'watch tower\' recall a medieval fortress; the blind arch motif on wall surfaces seems to be the vestigial remains of a Renaissance arcade. Although the broken exterior massing is as modern as Rockefeller Center, the plan harks back to Palladio\'s Villa Rotunda." The family of six requested separate rooms for all kids as well as the two live-in maids. Following classical rules, the house is symmetrical, axial, rooms separated and nearly similar; the entrance is placed at one end of the axis with the living room on the other; the central foyer features a skylight; Colburn noted the advantages of having isolated rooms: "If one room is messy, you can simply close the doors. When spaces \'flow\' into one another a la modern efficiency, it is difficult if not impossible to shut one area off from the rest." (though he acknowledged this compartmentalization may be difficult for a family without servants) The interior was by renowned NYC-based designer Alexander Girard, known for his work for the Herman Miller Textiles Division, who embraced the formality of the design but added variety through color, texture and light. As P/A noted "The result is a house that looks grand on the exterior because of its size. Yet, on the interior, spaces themselves are not large, and grandeur is achieved instead by the formality of the plan -- the total arrangement of the small spaces. Thus, from the outside, the house is most awesome and seems to express man\'s potential for power and glory; inside, the small, enclosed rooms are protective, fulfilling his emotional need for shelter." An August 1965 P/A article on Colburn\'s "preoccupation with arches" discussed a "danger with dedicated use of a particular design vocabulary is that it can become monotonous, superficial, and, worst of all, inappropriate." However the piece noted that, by keeping it to buildings of modest size (giving examples of 6 houses and an award-winning church), Colburn manages to "ring some interesting changes on it," noting that on Dragon Peak they are "immensely imposing in a Veblenesque manner" [the rare adjective refers to the high-quality of the good], it further added "It is interesting to note, however, that despite their romantic aspects, most of these buildings have quite open, sometimes Miesian plan (there is an occasional turret den or fun alcove, but wothehellarchie, we only live once!)"

To make the most of the view, all the main rooms were placed on the second floor (noted to significantly reduce foundation costs); the exterior was originally vertical cedar painted white; the upper level originally connected to the driveway from a ramp along the side of the house; the raised basement is made of concrete block, somewhat smaller than the upper floor, which cantilevers at front and back (providing protection for lower-level windows while also giving "the major floor the prominence in the design that it deserves." Architectural Record drew particular note to the "interesting treatment of the nearly all-glass southeast facade [...] Slightly heavy window framing members give a distinct pattern for relief and a sense of scale to the design" with the roof and side walls extended beyond the window for protection, with lights in the overhang illuminating the side at night. The stairway was highlighted for "Contrasts of metal rods and wooden shapes" in the lower floor while it "quiets to simple lines at the second story level." The fireplace, set on a stone bench slap, featured a "plain but well-designed" trapezoidal hood that contrasts with the stone wall behind it.

The lower floor, partially below grade, was designed to contain sleeping and dressing areas; the lower level also included below-grade areas for utilities and storage, that formed the terrace for the upper level; for economy, the design used standard materials using simple architectural details, with exposed structural steel, wood joists framed into steel channels, and a wood deck roof; with extensive glazing, the original plan was for privacy and sun protection to come from existing trees. In the notes for the 1957 citation, Abrahamson noted "The solution was prompted by the slope of the lot, which drops 30 ft, and by the desire to lift the living space onto a platform to take full advantage of the view." The P/A jury comprised Marcel Breuer (chairman), Gordon Bunshaft, Huson Jackson, Harry Weese, and Emil H. Praeger (Engineer)). The exposed steel frame, wood sash, and door frames were painted white, the redwood siding gray, and exterior doors blue-black. The completed house was then subject of a feature in the March 1959 issue of P/A, where Abrahamson noted "I was primarily concerned with creating a clean, simple building form and plan consistent with my design principles and the economy desired. [. . .] One of the prime motivations was the wish to prove that a steel-and-glass house, which would provide the desired esthetic, could be built in a cold climate and still not cost any more than the standard and accepted methods of house construction used in this area." The cost ended up bearing his plan out: The home was built as a cost of slightly more than $10 per square foot (much lower than custom houses in the area), for a total home cost of $20,900 (including garage). In the designer\'s notes for the 1959 AIA MN Award, he added "The bedrooms below and living above plan was the result of using the existing grades to provide maximum view for upper floor as well as to condense the space into the most compact, economical volume." The 1959 jury comprised Pietro Belluchi (Dean of MIT\'s architecture program), Ronald Gourley (Assoc. Prof, Harvard), and Lawrence B. Anderson (MIT), which commented "A two-story small house reduced to the absolute minimum of essential elements. In stripping it the architect showed great sensitivity, keeping repose and a sense of space in spite of tininess. Externally the house appears a little heavy because the various frame members are not scaled down to the small dimension of the house." Builder: Warren A. Ortenblad. While a student at the University of Minnesota, Abrahamson worked for Prof. Robert G. Cerny (who was then working with Long & Thorshov, which later evolved to The Cerny Assoc.); in 1950 he received a scholarship to the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he became a student of Walter Gropius, and after a working for several years in Chicago at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (and visiting with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe) returned to Minnesota in 1954 to join Hammel & Green; the firm would later be named Hammel, Green & Abrahamson (HGA).

P/A noted how the house was constructed burlap, fiberglass and polyurethane foam: "Wedin began by pouring a steel-reinforced concrete mast rising 22 ft above the footings. Six 3/4-in. nylon cables were then extended from the mast and anchored in the ground to form the skeleton of the structure. Burlap stretched over and sewed to the cables provided a backing for a 3-in. insulating layer of polyurethane foam. The liquid foam, which adheres particularly well to burlap, is sprayed from a gun, increasing to 30 times its original volume and hardening completely within one minute. Over the foam layer, Wedin applied a fiberglass surface, and covered it, in turn, with a gel coat of raw earth-colored pigment, giving the completed roof a ceramic look." The interior is just as unique as the exterior, with free-form, almost cave-like features: "inner and outer walls were formed by placing 2x2s and metal lathe between earth and ceiling, spraying them first with foam, and then with a covering layer of fiberglass or nylon. Floors are foam over the dirt base, covered with a layer of concrete, and a finish of seamless plastic. Plastic plumbing pipes and electrical wiring are buried in the ground and within the foam walls. Burlap serves as a base for sculptured foam construction such as a demi-wall surrounding a conversation pit in front of the fireplace. The fireplace flue is the hollow core of the 10-in.-thick concrete mast. Rooms are arranged around this central area, each on a separate level, and connected by stairs and ramps. [. . .] Additional foam applications include the pivoting-style hollow core front door, a pear-shaped planter in the entry, several built-in benches, demi-walls, and a built-in sleep shelf in one of the bedrooms. Many light fixtures have also been built in as extensions of the wall treatment. The project was named by sculptor Richard Scott for "ENvironmental SCULlpture in plasTIC" and co-conceptualized in an early form with Stuart "Boot" Gordon, a teacher at The Blake School (who would later design his own foam house in Aspen). The Minnetrista house was originally named "E-III" (The Littlejohn Home) and first proposed commissioned in 1966; E-IV was proposed to the Walker Art Center as a summer student sculptural project; eventually E-III was built in 1969-70 with students from Auburn University with some help from Boot Gordon and Richard Scott. Boot Gordon own landmark foam house (Silverthorne, Colorado) demonstrates how not having an architect involved can result in something more unfocused and chaotic (but charming).

Anderson (Dean of MIT school of architecture and planning, served as chairman), Gunnar Birkerts (architect), Romaldo Giurgola (architect), Richard P. Dober (planner), Fazlur Khan (engineer). The church was built on a large, flat site next door to a 1950s modern Catholic school (1950-51) and rectory (1950); the program was for a church seating 700 people, having a baptistry area integrated with the nave at its entrance, a small chapel, community center with kitchen, library, administrative facilities, garage facilities, and guest quarters; furthermore, due to a pre-existing restrictive covenant, it could only use the SE corner of the lot, and needed to connect physically with the existing school. Architects wanted the design to harmonize with the single-family homes in the neighborhood, drawing a contrast to the blocky and unattractive school on the site, thus careful attention was paid to scale and materials (reddish-buff brick bearing walls throughout); the church is oriented so that liturgical east is compass west, large narthex at the north end of the church leads to all areas of the new structure as well as to the school, and the baptistry is open to the nave at its entrance; church interior is skylighted; the two-bedroom guest quarters were placed over the garage at the north of the new building; a planned future rectory (connecting to the guest house/garage) was made but never built.

Subject of an extensive, 6-page feature in April 1978 issue of the AIA Journal. The January 1980 issue of AIA Journal included it as a primary illustration of the importance of energy-efficient design concerns in the 1970s. The $3.5M, mostly subterranean building was initially referred to as the "East Bank Bookstore / Admissions and Records Facility" and soon named for former Dean of Student E.G. Williamson. Designed with 83,000sf, split into approx. 25k bookstore, 35k admissions and records, 23k pedestrian circulation and student support functions. The siting was complex: semi-enclosed by several historic buildings, it also took into account most of the existing circulation patterns by being bisected by a diagonal pedestrian concourse. Coincidentally, the decision to go underground was reached in 1972, before the proclamation of an energy crisis; the main reason for placing the building underground was to preserve scarce open space on a very densely developed campus; to preserve views of two historic buildings, and to keep existing pedestrian traffic unobstructed from the southeast to the northwest corners of the site. To combine the desire to conserve energy and minimize disruption to the space between existing buildings, it was designed 95% below grade. Principle architect, David J. Bennett, noted the first time the approach was brought to the university\'s building committee, "the reaction was very negative. The bookstore and some of the offices were at the time in basement spaces and people thought that with this concept they would just be moving from an old basement to a new one." Bennet said the reaction "sensitized us to potential problems, and had an impact on the development of the design" so the design needed to strike a balance between "maximizing energy conservation and, at the same time, human satisfaction." To keep the building energy efficient and humane (and open), the design was oriented to give light and views through a large sunken courtyard with tiers of windows. In deciding where to place each function, the architects assumed that that bookstore employees and visitors would need less sun, light and visual stimulation from outdoors than office workers, especially those doing relatively routine work. Thus, the bookstore was placed on the lower level of the two-story structure. Ambient light enters the bookstore space through a sloped glass east wall. The bookstore management insisted on a clerestory window so passersby could see the products, but the glass ended up being so reflective it just acted as a mirror. The building was designed to recycle heat from lighting fixtures and people. An interior bridge permits views down into working areas. The building was designed with board-formed architectural concrete in buff integral color; rough concrete walls on the interior, with simple, strong lines like wooden railings and benches. Starting at 10ft below ground level, the soil temperature in Minneapolis stays constant at about 50°F, even while while air temperature varies between -35° and 95°. The 1975 P/A jury consisted of Paul Rudolph (chairman), Peter Chermayeff, Peter Eisenman, and Eberhard H. Zeidler; their comments: Zeidler: "If you look at the orientation of the existing buildings, you see that you were really left with fragments of spaces. With this building, the spaces find their solutions. One thing I would criticize is the receiving area [east side of building]; it somehow seems to turn its back on this space to the east." Eisenman: "I think when you sink a building into the ground that it\'s very important to make a distinction between walking on a building and walking on ground. I think also that the notion of this diagonal is alien to the nature of the campus structure, in terms of its built artifacts. I think it\'s an imposition into the tranquility of the campus." Rudolph: "I would like to make a rebuttal to that. It seems that, for once, the diagonal makes considerable sense because of the general circulation pattern of the campus. The diagram shows that very clearly." Chermayeff: "It seems to me that the issue really is what happens at eye level. The apparent aggression of the geometry, in this case, is not aggressive at all. It\'s really quite a reticent building; there is no overpowering form intruding on the campus. This is not part of the \'diagony\' we\'ve been joking about." Zeidler: "It\'s amazing the very pleasant spaces it does create inside." The 1977 AIA Minnesota jury remarked "A sensitive project addressing itself to urban design, historic preservation, human behavior and energy conservation." The (jury: William Marshall, Jr., Arthur J. Fox, Jr., Edward Killingsworth, William C.

Wheeler (PE)] noted "It is worked very nicely into an old part of the campus, a crowded area. / The architects recognized what we call the soil temperature. If you go down so far, the earth has a constant temperature. Utilizing that as a base, the organized the design concept to use that temperature for more efficient heating. / This is really tied into the urban environment--the many different walkways that cut around the campus. / If you look at it from the side, it\'s something like a terrace walking into the ground. / They used natural plants in a very imaginative way for external shading--the leaves providing added shade in summer, the bar branches letting in more light in winter."

(Max Oftedal, PE); Builder: Sheehy Const. Co. Its completion was noted again in the July 1977 issue of P/A. Originally, planters formed sun control devices on south and west sides where direct sun could cause heat gains: Bennett collaborated with university landscape architect Clinton N. Hewitt to use a species of native deciduous vine plant that would shade the interior space in the summer, and retreat in winter to allow light to warm the common spaces. Bennett noted "The whole idea was to make an integrated system." Those plants were altered over time. Featured in ads for CRSI and Owens-Corning Fiberglas, the latter included a photo of Bennet, Hewitt, and Oftedal posing in one of the green roof sections of the completed project. The university received a $242,000 grant from the National Science Foundation for Thomas Bligh, a professor of mechanical engineering at the university, to monitor the building\'s energy performance. The rise in interest in earth-berm and otherwise underground buildings led 2 University of Minnesota psychologists to run a study on employees working in Williamson that suggested they were "significantly less satisfied with their workplace, were more likely to think negatively about it and would be less likely to want to work in a similar structure in the future. They were more likely to rate their work environment as \'unpleasant, dangerous, musty, dark, smothering, unfriendly, gloomy and isolating." One of the professors running the study, Philip C. Kendall, was later known for developing Coping Cat as an evidence-based and empirically supported treatment for anxiety in youth; the other, Steven D. Hollon, became known for his work in cognitive behavioral therapy. Kendell further noted "It would be an odd culture, indeed, if we changed so much that we thought the cityscape ought to look like a flat park rather than a skyline. I\'m from just outside New York. When people would come to see me, I would show them the city. There is a pride and an attachment to that. If everything were underground, there would be nothing to see." There was one major leak after opening, resulting from a tear in the roof membrane during construction; a second, near catastrophe, was avoided during a torrential downpour when it was realized that the drains at the entranceways were too small to absorb the storm waters and the building would have been swamped had it not been for two janitors who positioned themselves at the entranceways and swept the water aside (the drains were then enlarged). The 1978 AIA Journal piece, visiting the building during "shakedown stage" was impressed, noting "The interior comes as something of a surprise, a decidedly pleasant one." It noted the "vast majority of user complaints about the building are largely unrelated to its being underground" (e.g. moving to an open office environment from an old fashioned closed door office, as well as a dislike for the Herman Miller office furniture, and even "too much sun" and too much heat); the main concern related to being underground was leaks. "A very typical remark by a bookstore employee was, \'There\'s so much light. You can look out and you don\'t have the feeling of being underground or crowded.\'" The building was over-capacity almost immediately, designed for 180 people, it had 200 when the AIA Journal piece was published; the school had planned a computerized class registration system at the time the building was designed but it was dropped, leading to massive lines of students that were never accounted for in the design, to which Bennett quipped "It\'s the sort of situation where the architect would like to put a plaque on the wall reading, \'If you have some concern with crowding, talk to Them.\'" The structure\'s biggest issues with energy conservation and human comfort came from the University Building Committee\'s fear and demands for overcompensating a perceived lack of sunlight underground. The architects originally planned for a louver system to screen out direct light, but the committee vetoed all plans which would diminish sun penetration. Bennett noted "They were still fearful of creating a dungeon, even though we warned them that if anything we were going to suffer from too much sun penetration." The alternative concept of using of ivy and juniper plans to screen seemed to work in summer but, in the words of engineer Bligh, "It was only when I started doing an energy analysis on the building that I discovered that the lack of shuttering is just terrible in terms of winter heat loss." Both Bennett and Bligh felt they learned a lot about what did not work. Bligh felt the design used too much glass placed too high and at too steep an angle: "It was a bad mistake to have acceded to the bookstore management\'s desire to have clerestories at ground level overlooking the bookstore sales floor. That glass is right at the top where all the heat rises." (the original plan was for a much lower grassed terrace with a number of skylights set on the terrace) "I thought it was much prettier, and certainly from an energy point of view it would have been superior. It turns out that glass, double-glazed or not, is the worst offender as far as heat loss is concerned. It also turns out that we now know that sloping glass loses much more heat than glass on a vertical. We\'ve got a lot of sloped glass that isn\'t necessary." Both Bennett and Bligh wished the waterproofing membrane of the roof had been carried down the outside wall of the building to the footings for extra safety. In 2003 the University consolidated the East Bank and West Bank bookstores into a new, larger facility in the expanded basement of the renovated and remodeled student union building (that would be the 3rd consecutive basement location). The building was slated for eventual demolition per the University\'s 2009 Twin Cities Campus Master Plan.'),

Dalrymple Residence',E'Bliss & Campbell',E'1960-61',E'Recognized as a 1964 Record House by Architectural Record in its Awards of Excellence for House Design. Sometimes referred to as the "John S. Dalrymple Residence" due to the patriarchal conventions of the time that subsumed the female identity into that of her husband: Widowed in 1958, Bernice B. Dalrymple commissioned the husband-wife architect team of Robert L. & Anna (Campbell) Bliss to design her a one-level home on the 100\'x240\' lot without losing 7 elm trees. Dalrymple had previously looked for apartments but decided a new home was in order. The resulting long, four-bedroom, single-story house (56\'x132\'x8\', though some articles say it\'s 119\' feet long) uses lots of brick and glass over 3,000sf. Glass "allee" connects house to garage and one bedroom (originally for chauffer); Anna Bliss explained the layout of the passage: "We did this so that in coming into the house, you don\'t immediately see the whole courtyard, but catch glimpses of it on your way to the living area." The main living room featured narrow white oak paneling, intended to have 4 gathering corners for entertaining. Bliss curved some of the walls in an effort to stay as far as possible from the roots of the elm trees: "The curve also gives added stiffness to the walls and it\'s esthetically handsome." The roof floats above the walls, with glass clerestory windows in between the beams that support it; most of the eastern wall is glass to take advantage of the downtown view.  Dalrymple observed "All the east and west walls are curved. All the north and south walls are straight, so whatever way you put things, they look slightly off-center." Anna Bliss also did all the interior design. The house is best known for the enormous, circular skylight dome (18ft in diameter) built of an aluminum frame and glazed with heat-absorbing and glare reducing plastic; Dalrymple noted "I don\'t take credit for much in this house, but I do for the dome. Bob [Bliss] wanted to sink the floor and I said \'no.\' I have too many friends who have broken their bones on such steps, so I suggested pushing the roof up into a skylight dome, just like the one my grandmother used to have. You should see this room on a night with a full moon . . .with the moonlight and shadows on the floor and you\'re sitting in the center of the pie. It\'s quite lovely." The luxury house also featured maid\'s quarters, built-in hi-fi equipment. Robert Bliss said the problem was placing "a relatively large house between two large houses on land that was once the garden of one of them. [. . .] We had three purposes, to save the seven elm trees on the lot--and we didn\'t lose one--to treat the house enclosure as a space between a series of garden walls which are the walls of the house, and, finally, to create privacy from the street and private court areas within the living area of the house. Each one of the courts has complete protection from the others . . . the dining court from the living court, for instance, and the bedroom courts from the other parts of the house. And then, of course, we wanted to get sunlight into the house and give those inside a good view of the city." Dalrymple admitted "That enormous elm tree in the center is responsible for the crazy shape of this house. Eventually though, it\'ll be quite a nice cover for a flagstone terrace of the dining area." Dalrymple selected the gray shaded and glazed brick used on the interior and exterior walls: "I\'ve lived in a beige world too long and wanted change." The owner also had a small, rectangular fountain set into the wall of the entryway: "I think the sound of water running is a pretty sound. But I\'ve discovered that the fountain is practical as well. It acts as a humidifier." In Architectural Record (AR), the architects described it as "A one-story scheme with privacy and spatial interest" to take advantage of a restricted, but attractive site for a client active in social and cultural affairs who wanted a creative environment in which to begin a new pattern of life, noting they used "a series of receding \'garden\' walls defining spaces, creating courts, and giving privacy from the street." AR noted "These quiet courtyards, accessible from the various rooms, give the house an air of seclusion which is not easy to achieve on a restricted site of this kind. The gentle curve of the walls has the effect of softening what might otherwise appear to be a rather broken up design. The timber-framed roof is supported on the brick walls and a concrete slab foundation. [. . .] [I]t is interesting to see how the small windows between the beams make the roof appear to rest lightly on the walls. Although essentially contemporary in design and construction, the house fits well into the background of a traditional neighborhood and has itself something of the elegance of a past age." Dalrymple was president of the Minnetonka Garden Club, and very much cared about the landscape design. Costs of construction (permit estimates alone): $112,900. AR estimated it at $23.40 per square foot. Landscape architect: Edmund J. Phelps; Structural Engineers: Meyer & Borgman; Mechanical Engineers: Frey & Bergsten; Builder: Joe Peterson Const. Co. Robert was also a professor at the University of Minnesota at the time. Bliss & Campbell left Minnesota in 1963, when Robert was hired as the dean of the Department of Architecture at the University of Utah. Describing her house as part of her "third stage of life," Dalrymple lived there for 20 years, and died there on October 14, 1980, age 91. The Dalrymple fortune came from her husband\'s 30,000-acre wheat farm near Casselton, ND; her son John, Jr. died in 1971; his son, her grandson, John Stewart Dalrymple III, was the 32nd Governor of North Dakota.

The design was selected for exhibit at the 1960 school architecture conference of the American Association of School Administrators. It was also highlighted in January-February 1959 issue of Northwest Architect as part of its Works in Progress section. The $2M building was designed for 1200 students on a 23-acre rolling site; one-story school built around open courtyard with separate circular building for music classes. The main classroom structure housed 24 academic and 12 special classrooms, gymnasium with stage, library, cafeteria, and administrative offices arranged around an inner courtyard. The round building included band room, 2 chorus rooms, instrument room, and practice rooms. In their own remarks, the architects noted "The slope of the land to the south permitted two floors of academic classrooms both with easy access outdoors. Because the seventh and eighth grades are taught according to the \'Block System\' (no passing from room to room for different subjects), their classrooms are located on the upper floor away from heavy traffic areas. Music, which is an important element of the curriculum, is housed in a circular structure separated from the main building. This form derived from the dictates of seating arrangement, acoustical requirements and, of course, esthetic consideration. The construction system in generally a concrete frame and floor slab with bar joists and metal deck for roofs. The walls of the music suite support the precast thin shell concrete folded plate roof slabs. Exterior walls are brick with light-weight concrete block." The 1960 jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C. Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "This has an excellent plan—straightforward and logical—with the central circulation on two levels especially well handled. The jury was somewhat dubious about the special, and rather spectacular, form of the round music buildings, which seems to give it an importance not entirely justified by its function. We cannot question the wisdom of isolating such a group of rooms but we wonder if it is not slightly over-dramatic in its final effect, especially as compared with the simple block organization of the rest of the complex. The jury presumes that some landscaping treatment near the bleak sides of the building is in the offing as it was felt that such softening would be welcome." Builder: M.A. Mortenson Construction Co. Alas the notable circular building, connected by enclosed breezeway, was demolished in 2016 for massive school expansion toward Rice St and by 2020 the rest of school was demolished for parking lot of new school.'),
