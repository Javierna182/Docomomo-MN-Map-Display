Northern Pump Company was founded in 1929 by a merger of two Minneapolis companies at a complex they expanded at 1620 Central Ave NE. With the outbreak of hostilities in Europe, but before the United States was pulled into the conflict, huge military contacts were issued. Northern Pump received a $75M Naval ordnance order (5-inch 38-caliber naval guns) that was far beyond the capacity of their existing plant, so they opted to move here. In January 1941 Northern Pump relocated to this site, and in June 1942 created the subsidiary Northern Ordnance Incorporated to fulfill its federal production contracts. Originally a very large industrial building, which soon expanded into an even larger complex of very long industrial buildings (oriented east-west) running parallel with each other in a north-to-south stack. The original building was 1200\'x150\'x60\' and cost $1,000,000 in addition to more than $2,000,000 worth of machinery and tools for the manufacture of artillery mounts for the US Navy. The 60-acre site was but behind barbed wire for defense contract security. After WW2, Northern Ordnance continued its naval production. The replacement of the roofs with precast concrete roof slabs in the early 1950s was overseen by Milwaukee-based engineers Klug & Smith (Builder: Geo. F. Cook Const. Co.).

Coventry was an orthopedic surgeon who joined the Mayo Clinic in 1942, after serving in the Medical Corps of the United States Naval Reserve during WW2, he returned to practice, where he was known for several pioneering works: He was best known for performing the first total hip arthroplasty using an FDA-approved bone cement (in 1969), as well as popularizing the proximal tibial osteotomy (he performed the first in 1960). He also established the first total joint registry. He was the first to use cortisone (developed by Mayo Clinic physicians) for an orthopedic injury, he designed the use of prophylactic anticoagulants for pulmonary emboli, and he established the first total joint registry. He rose to chairman of the orthopedic department at the Mayo Clinic in 1955, where he initiated an innovative specialty-specific department organization; and became a full professor of the same subject. Coventry served as president of the American Orthopaedic Association, Clinical Orthopaedic Society, The Hip Society, the Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation, and other societies.

The brick apartment structure, with 5 two-bedroom apartments, was described in a Minneapolis Tribune feature (08/16/1948) as "modernistic," and blends echoes of the Moderne mixed with transitions into mid-century styles; designed with detached garage in back. James built it under what he cited as the traditional Chinese principle of "taking care of your own. [. . .] The Chinese take care of their families. It\'s a way of thinking." The Minneapolis Tribune described it as "a happy mixture of east and west – Although the building was inspired by an ancient Chinese tradition, the apartments are strictly modern American in design."

The building\'s initial tenants included his son & daughter-in-law, his brother, his widowed sister, his wife\'s sister, as well as "the families of some business associates."

James, who was born to an oyster worker in Olympia, Washington; he explained how his name was Anglicized: "People used to call my father James, from his Chinese name Yim Dune. Well, back then everybody was a Jim or James or something. So James became our surname. My Chinese given name was Wah; so I became Walter James." After moving to China for a few years to live with relatives, he returned to the Seattle area to work managing a Chinese restaurant, interpreting for the US Immigration Service, as well as general entrepreneurial work. He moved to Chicago in 1913 to work at a restaurant, and ended up moving to Minneapolis where he opened his first Chinese restaurant, Canton, and in 1919 opened a second one, Nankin Café, in downtown Minneapolis. The latter became a cultural hub for the Chinese-American community in the state. In 1949 he founded the Chinese American Club, which became the Chinese American Association of Minnesota (CAAM). He was posthumously named the 2009 Chinese Minnesotan of Note by the Chinese Heritage Foundation (Twin Cities). Despite racial prejudice creating a need for a building for his family, by 1948 James felt it was not as bad as his own earlier experience: "In a way, I can\'t blame people for being prejudiced. They don\'t know any Chinese and they\'re not used to seeing us. But after they get to know us, we get along fine."'),

Real estate developer L.Z. Carlson and builder W.A.

Carlson kept the original farmhouse, which became his own house, and used the barn into a precutting mill. While the shopping center never materialized, the park and many houses did across 3 phases. The initial wave was 100 ramblers across 1947-48 with 6 basic floor plans to create variety in appearance, with 39 of the first 50 houses having different facades. Each of the first 100 houses were 3-bedroom and one bath, one-story with full basement, and included living room, kitchen, dining room or area, and a fireplace in the living room and basement for a potential recreation area. Carlson noted "there has been so much emphasis on two-bedroom houses that it seemed time someone entered the three-bedroom field." The division was featured in a February 1950 national ad for the Richmond Radiator Co.\'s Richmond Plumbing Fixtures and Richmond Gas-Fired Winter Air Conditioner that were used by builder Wilkorp, Inc. on the first 100 homes. The 2nd addition (far west blocks) were built in the mid/late-1950s and the 3rd addition (block south of park) was built in the 1960s.

Built on a 96-acre tract on Stockton Hill, the cross-shaped building is of rough-faced Mankato stone; the 3-story structure included housing, offices, classrooms, lounges, and chapels. Per the members of the Society of St. Pius X who took over the facility in 1988: "Our new home is a veritable fortress of the Faith. The Dominicans took no half-measures in its building. Its walls reflect the invincibility of the Truth taught within them," further noting " The main chapel in Winona spares nothing to the King of Kings. The roof vaults upward in wood from walls of handsome travertine stone. The main altar rises from a jasper-colored predella back-dropped by a majestic twelve-foot crucifix on a facade of rose- and bronze-striated marble." At the time of its founding, it was the only novitiate in the Dominican Province of St. Albert the Great, which covered a 19-state Midwest area. The Novitiate portion was intended to house clerical novices for only one year, after which they would be sent to Dubuque for philosophy. It never reached maximum capacity as the level of those entering the vocation immediately after World War II declined as time led up to Vatican II.  The last complete Novitiate year here was 1969-70, by which time there was extreme division over doctrine at a time of great social change. The program ended the following year and the building was maintained and used for some secular uses for 16 years until it was acquired by the Society of St. Pius X (1988-2016); most recently became the independent Holy Angels Novitiate.'),

Originally 33 lots; As of a Minneapolis Tribune feature on the neighborhood on 04/30/1950, 14 of the first 15 homes were designed by Norsen, who studied mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota. The only non-Norsen house among the first 15 was Close Assoc.\'s Dr. Ruth Boynton & Prudence Cutright House (180 Norman Ridge). In explaining his design philosophy, Norsen stated "One of my basic assumptions is that most men want to keep their wives happy and young. To do it, they need a house that any ordinary woman can take care of herself, and still have time to enjoy other things in life besides housework." His designs were one-level, featured big fireplaces out of aggregate slag blocks (most with raised, cantilevered hearths, grates made of firebrick rather than steel, some that open two-way, and some with brass hoods), big living rooms with open plans and few doors outside of the usual private areas, usually 3 bedroom, plywood paneling instead of plaster, no footings (wood deck built over structural slab of concrete), large double-pane windows with additional use of clerestory windows in living rooms, passive solar heating on the south, accordion doors (especially between children\'s rooms so they can open up for play), tar and gravel roofs (especially on flat roofs).

Griffith): "We have attempted to capture the spirit of Unitarianism in the design of the Main Auditorium by contrasting the simple box shape, representative of the Universe, with the undulating ceiling, used to represent the confines of human life within this shell. The ceiling wraps down visually to enfold the speaker who is the interpreter of human relations with the Universe. The large window to the north also expands the limits of the Auditorium and includes Nature in the perspective." The P/A piece further explored the use of color, which was "carefully planned to be soft and harmonious. Sandalwood painted plaster walls blend with brick surfaces. The ceiling is bluish-gray supported by contrasting, terra cotta colored columns to accentuate the floating quality of the ceiling. Walnut paneling is used to focus attention and be a background for the speaker\'s rostrum [itself curved wood]. Flooring is brown tile mottled with terra cotta, while the draperies and carpet are beige." Particularly credited to Roy Thorshov; The structure cost $300,000 and was designed with a seating capacity of 730; included in Minneapolis Tribune feature (11/22/53) on the rise in modern churches.

"Bob" Nordgren (d.2000, age 85) was a research chemist for General Mills who was active in DFL politics; he ran for the state legislature in 1948 on a platform backing public education and ideas such as giving college scholarships to the top performing high schoolers in Minnesota, in 1947 he was a ward campaign manager for then-Mayor Hubert H, Humphrey in 1947. In the mid-1950s he served as president of the Prospect Park & East River Road Improvement Association. He and Vivian (d.2015, age 97) were very active birdwatchers, with Robert as president of the Minnesota Bird Club. The Nordgrens had three daughters, Janet, Susan, and Peggy. The house stayed in the family until 2015. The house is a contributing property to the Prospect Park Residential Historic District that was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.'),

When built, it was the only house sited on Eagle Bluff in what was then-considered Mound. The long (120\') and fairly narrow house with a walk-out basement overlooks both Halsted Bay and Priest Bay. Featured in the Minneapolis Tribune (08/07/1960) for its use of passive solar to help heat the home.  Exterior featured two levels of large floor-to-ceiling glass windows, including windows spanning the length of the 57-foot living-dining room, with baseboard ducts that blew a curtain of warm air in front of the glass on winter nights. The design of the house helped to keep the house warm in the winter in spite of all those windows. By aiming the walk-out basement towards the south (and buried by earth on the north side) it keeps the sun heating the home. The house also featured long overhanging eaves on the upper level and balcony over the lower level to help keep out the summer sun and ample stacked stone on other surfaces. The house initially had a "7½-ton air conditioner to keep the temperature down." Window sills were originally Formica; the floors were all done in terrazzo, with "a different color in each room," and all the walls were wood-paneled with different woods in each room (white maple in girls\' room, red oak in boys\' room, African mahogany in master bedroom, butternut in living room, and pecky cypress, rift oak, and Philippine mahogany in other rooms.  The kitchen was designed to blend in with built-in appliances and cupboards all below waist-level. There was originally a pool to the south of the home, with dressing rooms built under it as well as an outdoor barbecue and sink on one end; it was removed by the time the property was broken up. Kromer may have sold the home in 1988 (when the property was likely subdivided) and died in 2002, age 96; he was Chief Engineer of the Bomber Project at Northwest Airlines during World War II and later started the O.W. Kromer Company, which designed and manufactured farm sprayers, skid-steer loaders, and most recently, the Kromer Athletic Field Maintainer.'),

Electric appliance manufacturer Hotpoint Co. (division of General Electric) was celebrating its 50th anniversary in 1955.  To celebrate they ran a contest with prizes including 4 fully-furnished modern homes (packed with Hotpoint products), and also prizes consisting of kitchen and laundry combination packages, as well as a few thousand appliances. To come up with the home designs, Hotpoint cooperated with Living for Young Homemakers magazine to research and develop 4 modern pilot model homes, creating an architectural program based on a nationwide survey of young homemakers (under 35) to learn about the most desirable features in a house.  The plan was to design and build the 4 prototype model homes in the southern, eastern, western, and midwestern parts of the country.  Living for Young Makers commissioned Nagle to design the midwestern model. The pilot model home is located at 703 W. Busse Ave in Mount Prospect, Illinois.  According to an Illinois newspaper article, Hotpoint spent over a million dollars on research for the Nagel designed model home in Mount Prospect. Builders around the country also built model homes based on the designs used for the four prototypes.  For this Edina model home, it\'s plausible Furney Bros. received some support or funding from Hotpoint towards construction, decorating, or advertising costs. The Hillcrest home does sound like it had some luxury to it.  Some nice features included: large windows, "an overhead skylight of fibered plastic," clay tile flooring in the halls and kitchen, a 3-zone system for the heating and cooling as well as a built-in radio system.  The plan was advertised nationally as being one level, but a 3-zone system suggests Furney put in a basement. On the outside, the house appears as a small one-story house with board-and-batten siding, low glass-filled gables and brick garage. Builder: Furney Bros. Construction Corp.; Decorating: Lucille R. Smith. James H. Furnery was president of the Furney Bros. Construction Corp., a mid-century home builder that was founded in 1949 and featuring homes on the Parade of Homes. '),

The initial costs were considerably lower (initially $8.53 per square foot, with an average that reduced to $8 per sf after an add\'n) than other high schools in the region. The initial design followed the "Maximlite School" system developed (and patented in 1956) by Thayer Ewing (T.E.) Shelton of Fayetteville, Arkansas, and licensed through local architect B. J. Knowles & Co. The system was based on hexagonal structure clusters that allowed for easy expansion, inexpensive construction, and (highlighted by its name) the maximization of natural light. Light was increased by the hexagonal wall design, which increased the surface area, with walls implementing a significant amount of light-directing glass blocks, directing the light upward to reduce glare. The hexagonal design also reduced material costs by eliminating wasted space, and allowed for rapid fire evacuation. Maximlite Schools were built across the USA and Canada for a short period ending in the early 1960s (concentrated in the Arkansas/Oklahoma/Missouri region surrounding Fayetteville). Major addition in 1958 (183,000) expanded the Maximlite design, adding 10 more classrooms, physics and chemistry labs, and an additional A/V room. The corresponding women\'s high school, St. Margaret\'s Academy (1959-60), was also designed with the Maximlite system. A dormitory was part of the plan. The residence for the brothers was featured in an ad by Pella Windows in the January-February 1959 issue of Northwest Architect. Christian Brothers ended their sponsorship of Benilde in 1970 and turned administration over to the monks from St. John\'s University, who staffed many of the teaching positions.

The lobby included an elaborate sculpture and mural by noted artist Evelyn Raymond, featured in 04/18/57 article in the Minneapolis Tribune: 5 carved figures of farmers, 30-inches high as "part of a striking mural in the lobby of the new building [ . . . ] Set against a map of rough-textured terrazzo with free-form splashes of soft color, the black walnut figures give a dramatic effect from the road as cars swing around a curve and pass the brightly lit display [ . . . ] The stone map includes the strip of northern states form Wisconsin to Idaho. Bands of brass loop across the mural, roughly defining the areas of the six types of agriculture represented in the membership of the Farmers Union Central Exchange. The wood carvings (a sixth is yet to come) illustrate those kinds of farming--dairying, hog and wheat farming, sheep herding, irrigation farming and ranching. The figures are very simple and their symbolism is clear, restrained and uncomplicated. They have a warmth and naturalness which are appealing to the constant visitors to the building. But they also have a bold style in their chunky design and smooth finish which gives them a distinctly modern artistic flair." Ellerbe\'s art consultant, Warren Mosman, explained the practical use of the sculpture in the marble lobby: "It screens the coat room behind it, gives tone to the lobby and provides something interesting for the visitors to look at as they assemble to start the official tour, and it symbolizes the area and scope of activities of the exchange."

The Church was the first in the Iron Range to have a campanile (freestanding bell tower); the 75-foot tower comprises a pair of slightly concave forms, faced in quartz, with the void in between enclosed on two sides with more stained glass that compliments the sanctuary. The architectural program was overseen by the Pastor of St. Joseph\'s, Rt. Rev. Monsignor John E. Schiffer, and Assistant Pastor Rev. Michael T. Skumavc; it involved balancing the budgetary requirements of the congregation and working with Jyring & Whiteman to develop, in the words of the Church\'s publications, "a contemporary structure indicative of the economics involved, the structural concept, the inherent nature of the building materials and most of all, the sincere desire to create an atmosphere conducive to the worship of God." The garage and heating plant were built first (to take care of the new buildings as well as the existing Sister\'s home and Parish Center); the two-story rectory with full basement was added next, followed by the main church. The form of the main church is a large rectangle placed on a rectangular base of native split-faced granit. The façade used to have a statue of crucified Christ the King offset to the left and affixed to a concrete mullion between the panels of stained glass, but it was removed at some point (the connection points are still visible). The upper sides of the large sanctuary space are filled with sections of brick (chosen to match the brick used on the Sister\'s home), alternating with thin vertical bays of stained-glass and quartz stone. Small arched dome over the altar (set back far from the edges of the large rectangular form), permitting a circular stained-glass clerestory (domed lantern) that casts colored light reflections on the class interior walls. The dome and belltower are topped with Celtic crosses. The matching Parish House and school have a concrete loggia forming a covered walkway in front. The interior of the main church was made to appear taller by use of floor-to-ceiling stained-glass windows; between the windows are the stations of the cross sculptured in bold relief and set in individual concave niches of sparking quartz-faced stone. A circular baptistry symbolizes the unity with God and the Church that the Sacrament of Baptism accomplishes. The curved apse is also of quartz stone. The basement of the main church has an assembly hall (with a capacity of 750 for assembly and 450 for dining), kitchen, coat check, and bathrooms. Design associated with Eino A. Jyring, Featured in an ad for Peter Dohmen Studios by, in the March-April 1960 issue of Northwest Architect, for its glasswork as "excellent examples of old world artistry in combination with American modern church architecture. This was achieved by the use of different shades and colors of industrial glass, thus reducing the cost of this 2500 sq. ft. of glass, without sacrificing artistic value."

For the 1960 awards submission, the architects noted "Design was for a maximum-size house for a doctor and wife and two children within a limited and restricted budget. Family requirements were fairly normal, with the desire that the children\'s bedrooms and recreation area be separated from the adult living. Site was slightly rolling piece of land fronting on a small lake to the east and overlooking a small, pleasant lagoon to the north. [. . .] Living level with two bedrooms was placed on upper level to take advantage of view. Children\'s bedrooms and recreation were on ground, opening directly out to lake level, Wood framed construction was employed for regional and cost reasons with exterior using grey stained shakes to harmonize with locale." Builder: Ed Wahlstrom Const. Co. The 1960 jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C. Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "The jury was in accord in feeling that this would be a pleasant house in which to live. The general siting is attractive. In the simple plan the entrance is especially inviting and the relationships of the living room to the deck and the deck to the house add further visual pleasure. We all were pleased with the warmth of the shingles which contrast well with the discreet lineal geometry of the horizontal and vertical lines." Dr. Alan P. Thal, MD (1925-2014) and his wife, Felicia Jacobs, were South Africans; Alan graduated with a medical degree from the University of Cape Town (\'49) and did his internship in the United States at Cornell in pathology (1950-51), and another in surgery at Johns Hopkins (1952-53); he then finished his residency at the University of Minnesota where he completed a PhD and was a member of the original Open Heart Team at the University of Minnesota from 1953-60 (where he was also an Associate Professor of Surgery). He then moved to Detroit to serve as chairman of the Department of Surgery at Wayne State University, and then moved on to the University of Kansas Medical Center. During this era he had 150 publications from 1966 to 1972. In 1972 he decided to enter ranching and raising purebred Hereford cattle, he picked the New Mexico town of Golondrinas where he could also practice as a local surgeon; he practiced there from 1972 until an illness forced retirement in 1994, then kept researching and painting until his death.

Griswold & Assoc.',E'1958',E'1959 AIA MN Merit Award for the initial phase (completely ruined in a remodel), a long two-story building now used for Sunday school classes at the south end of the current complex that was designed with narrow windows set behind vertical fins. The space between fins allowed for some simple but creative patterns in between fins; the masonry also showed interesting patterns in their coursing. The ceiling had exposed beams in certain areas. The north end included a mostly solid masonry wall bearing a large cross (obscured by the additions). The designers noted: "This is the first unit of a construction program to be accomplished over a period of years for a newly organized congregation. The Sunday school unit was chosen as the first element to be constructed, with the stipulation that it be designed to serve presently as a place for adult worship as well as a Sunday school. The budget was low, requiring careful planning and selection of structure and materials. The site, which is a densely wooded area, influenced the design materially and the co-operative spirit of the contractor aided in a true execution of the architectural concept." The jury comprised Pietro Belluchi (Dean of MIT\'s architecture program), Ronald Gourley (Assoc. Prof, Harvard), and Lawrence B. Anderson (MIT), who noted that it may have been worthy of an even higher class of award had the photographs been better! Their comment: "This is a wing which will contain only adjunct facilities when eventually the real church is realized. The jury was hampered here by imperfect photographs and it may be that this entry deserves one of the highest awards. The design appears to be carried out in a free, romantic manner with no dogmatic ideas of what makes good composition. The plan conveys ease and flexibility to an unusual degree for such a modest structure. In the nave proper a religious atmosphere has been created without any specific climax, through the skillful design of the window wall. This wall appears to have depth, color and modulation through the use of very simple means. As seen from the outside, too, the building seems to have been built as naturally as a barn, yet it is texturally rich and evocative of its purpose." First-phase builder: Halverson-Stahr Co.; Cost: $129, 554.86. Featured as a notable church ahead of the 1960 national conference (in the Twin Cities) of the Church Architectural Guild of America & the Department of Church Building and Architecture of the National Council of Churches of Christ and published in the March-April 1960 issue of Northwest Architect (conference theme "The Modern Church: its Message and its Architectural Challenge"); local architect Gordon A. Schlichting, of Armstrong & Schlichting, was Assistant General Chairman of the conference and noted Minnesota was considered at the time to be "the cradle of the birth of contemporary church architecture in these United States." The main sanctuary was built sometimes between 1967 and 1971. Over the years the congregation has been referred to as being in Navarre, Orono, and as the Wayzata Good Shepherd; it settled in on Good Shepherd Lutheran Church. It is unclear when the original, award winning structure was remodel into the bland, embarrassing state it is in now, but the result is a travesty and makes one wish that it could be restored using modern construction materials that would make it just as stunning as it had been in the past (this is not meant as an indictment of the subsequent main sanctuary, which is fine on its own merits).'),

The addition, to the side of the original 1909 building by Frank W. Kinney & Jogerst, was originally an infill lot, with a structure to its immediate west (since demolished). It connects via a glass atrium (where the original brick walls of the old building are visible); the street-facing side is otherwise a monolithic wall of bricks coursed in a Flemish bond pattern; the façade is framed top-and-bottom with large stone blocks; the flat roof has a dark metal fascia. The only ornamentation on the brick wall is the name of the building in a classic midcentury sans serif type (McLEOD COUNTY COURTHOUSE) and 7 lights spaced evenly, alongside two above the atrium doors. These lights were originally larger but have been replaced with shorter versions. The program was to add air-conditioned office, vault, and courtroom spaces with a high fire rating in a space that was limited in size. Per the remarks of the architects: "It was resolved by containing all assignable space within a three-story fireproof vault without exterior openings, separated from the existing space by a circulation court. Office and vault space were located to relate to existing function in the old building. The concept of the arcaded court with open balconys[sic], providing circulation to the new spaces, serves as transitional element between the old and new units. The decision to leave out all exterior openings heightens the efficiency of the air conditioning and fireplroofing." Builder: Gunner I. Johnson & Sons; construction costs: $447,487.35. The 1960 jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C.

The new part, while being an entity in itself, is sensitively related to the old building without making any compromises. Neither the new building nor the joint itself offends the old building and, in return, the old building seems to enhance the new. The general detailing of the metalwork next to the brick seems particularly good. The jury questions the lights on the brick wall, which are an irritant to an otherwise serene quality."'),
