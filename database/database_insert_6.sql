The clients were a couple originally from Bavaria with two children, wanted a house in character with their background on what was a 3-acre wooded suburban lot with the best view to the northwest. In his own remarks on the design, Stageberg noted "The solution provides some elegant interior spaces within a simple shell. The pitched parts of the roof occur over the living room, kitchen, study and master bedroom. The dining room and entry overlook the living room and the northwest view." The 1965 jury met in MIT\'s Dept. of Architecture and, giving the house an Honorable Mention, remarked: "A simple, straightforward house well adapted to site, with interesting interior space and detail. The pitched parts of the roof and some of the fenestration seem rather arbitrary relative to the plan." Total cost was $34,000 in 1966. Stickler was a pediatrician who made substantial contributions to the field of pediatrics, including being the first scientist to describe a hereditary condition now known as Stickler syndrome; he retired in 1989 and died unexpectedly from stroke in 2010 at his home in Wayzata.

Stageberg visited the site 5 times, including at night to get a sense of the views. With careful siting and contour preservation, the split-level house only led to the removal of 4 of approximately 30 trees on site. Stageberg noted "Living close to trees in a house with a large expanse of glass gives a person more of the feeling of the change of seasons. And trees never have an ugly moment. Even in wintertime an apple tree has a wonderful, gnarled shape." The long house (55\'x28\') is all brick with exposed redwood beams and what was originally a wood roof; the entry has a covered canopy and the roof has long overhangs; the architect noted "We wanted to retain the natural qualities of the site so it seemed advisable to use natural materials . . . clay and wood."

The process garnered two separate newspaper features: 09/30/51 (Minneapolis Tribune) about the initial construction, 05/22/60 (The Minneapolis Star ) about how architects create interesting houses with difficult lots (plus the addition the built); Franz said he "used everything in the book" to safeguard the house he built on a slope in Lowry Hill; to safeguard against seepage and slippage; Franz said he and his wife "had to excavate three times as much gravel and sand overlay as we expected to get down to solid earth" when they began putting in the foundation for their converted shed home; the could dug it themselves, as no company would send machines to do it it for fear of starting a landslide; they buttressed the rear retaining wall with 16" horizontal and 12" lateral reinforcements; Franz said "We laid four-inch drain tile around three sides and filled in with crushed rock and gravel. Mastic coating was applied to the exterior of the backwalls. Maybe we went overboard a little, but we haven\'t had to wipe up a drop of water." Digging for the water main was fiasco because the city map was wrong (the city compensated them for the extra work). The 1951 article had photos of the wild design, under construction, with the then-engaged couple  still working on the natural cedar siding house; they had a traditional German house-raising ceremony, a Richtfest. In 1959 they doubled the size of their house by adding a living-room, two bedrooms add a bath in a side addition. The street was obliterated by the construction of I-94 in the 1960s; when it existed, Forest Ave ran parallel and just to the north of Ridgewood Ave, which is now (2020) where I-94 emerges from the Lowry Tunnel. By 1964 the Gayls bought an island on Lake Minnetonka and Franz\'s first plan was to move this house by barge; however they were “outbid” and opted to build a new house, while a section of this house (roughly matching the size of the \'59 addition) was moved on  September 10, 1964 to a new foundation built at 1133 Kenwood Pkwy in a vaguely similar topography (on the side of a steep hill); by 2020 the home still shows modern, but may be fundamentally a different house (with a new glass entry on the east side), though influenced by Gayl.

Franz wanted to live in the wilderness but his wife, Jane (nee Hauser), wanted to be near the city. The compromise was a  2.79 acres island in Lake Minnetonka that was cut from Big Island by a channel created by a previous owner.  After buying it, Jane mapped the island and the couple successfully petitioned to name the island Mahpiyata, after a Lakota princess that Jane found in Minnetonka legend. His original plan was to move the Forest Ave house by barge, but he was out-bid for the remaining section of the house (that was moved to 1133 Kenwood); to build the new house, he bought an Army surplus DUKW (aka a Duck, the 6-wheeled amphibious vehicle) to ferry building materials to the island, using a portable generating plant for electricity; his plan was to use the DUKW and a propeller-driven snow sled to get to and from the house to the mainland.  The house itself was designed with 3 bedrooms, a den, and 1 bath on the downstairs, and a kitchen, living, dining, and library upstairs; Gayl said it "isn\'t meant to be any particular style, it is the simplest structure possible, the least obtrusive, to disturb the natural surroundings as little as possible." At the time, Gayl was an architectural designer for Minnegasco, and Jane was a computer programmer who worked for Northwestern Bell, Univac, and General Mills (where she helped program the company\'s first mainframe computer system).

You can\'t handle more than about 30 to 35 patients in a single circle. [. . .] The secret is concentrating actual patient care in the circle. Extra services like the kitchens, teaching space, elevators and the rest are outside this patient circle. So the nurse is not distracted by noise or walking distance normal in a hospital.

You can\'t handle more than about 30 to 35 patients in a single circle. [. . .] The secret is concentrating actual patient care in the circle. Extra services like the kitchens, teaching space, elevators and the rest are outside this patient circle. So the nurse is not distracted by noise or walking distance normal in a hospital. The circle plan means either better care or fewer nurses--there\'s no question about that." Ellerbe meanwhile employed the design for the full Rochester Methodist Hospital (1963-66), and 3-tower (Cloverleaf) versions for Ancker Hospital (now Region\'s) and St Luke (now United Hospital) in St. Paul and a similar circular version at Lakeview Hospital in Stillwater; this shorter, 61-bed hospital replaced a 1907 structure, and has had additions in 1989, 2009, and beyond.

You can\'t handle more than about 30 to 35 patients in a single circle. [. . .] The secret is concentrating actual patient care in the circle. Extra services like the kitchens, teaching space, elevators and the rest are outside this patient circle. So the nurse is not distracted by noise or walking distance normal in a hospital. The circle plan means either better care or fewer nurses--there\'s no question about that." Ellerbe meanwhile employed the design for Lakeview Hospital in Stillwater (1959-61), St. Luke\'s Hospital (now United) in St. Paul (1960-61), and Ancker Hospital (now Region\'s) in St. Paul; by the time it was implemented in the full Rochester Methodist Hospital (1963-66) and here for Northwestern (now Abbott Northwestern), the footprint was an octagon rather than a curved circle; the original plan was for only 4-floors of the radial plan (it became 6, the design was expandable), which took the hospital\'s capacity from 270 to 390; the rest of the addition included clinical lab, new X-ray dept; emergency room, pharmacy, kitchen & cafeteria, OR, and recovery rooms; Builder: M.A. Mortenson. The original hospital wing (with U-shaped tower) originally fronted 810 27th St E, but that portion of the street was removed as the hospital later expanded south.

The program was a treatment center for alcoholics, to consolidate and expand several, with total residential capacity of 125 (100 were new) with common facilities for dining and group activities as well as library, chapel, and some shopping facilities. This architectural program was complicated by the need to meet the core of the Hazelden residential rehabilitation program: daily individual and group sessions of therapy and discussion, with success stemming from its small numbers, "peer-group therapy," and casual atmosphere--thus the organization wanted to still keep patients in groups of 18-20 and avoid seeming "too large. too impersonal. too institutionalized." The feature in P/A summarized the need for a new approach: "The alcoholic is sometimes very ill physically for a short time. \'but we don\'t want a hospital.\' Many of them are emotionally disturbed, \'but we don\'t want a mental hospital.\' Many need spiritual help, \'but we don\'t want a church.\' In some ways, they said, \'we want a hotel or motel atmosphere, but that isn\'t exactly it, either; in some ways we want a residential club.\'" The solution was a design meant to evoke a "hill village" (with a variety of placement, views, and elevations) that would keep an intimate scale for the individual, while making them feel like a part of a community. Residence units were built around the 18-22 patient therapeutic unit, with some common areas overlooking a central court; the architects envisioned each of the "therapy units" having "an integral form" that "becomes a neighborhood within the total community." Site drops 50ft to lake, the structures used masonry bearing-wall construction, with concrete slab on grade and precast-concrete roof deck; exteriors of red face brick for exterior walls with brick and lightweight concrete block for interior walls and limited use of vertical oak boards for partitions; total cost of the project was estimated at $1,400,000; Structural engineers: Schuett-Meier Co.; Mechanical engineers: Gausman & Moore, Inc.

"Since this was the first installation of its kind, gas company engineers recommended two furnace units. To be on the safe side, however, the company installed three. Yet in the first winter, just one unit was sufficient to handle both the factory and the office building when outside temperatures dropped to -18 F.

A primary purpose was connecting the two sides of the University of Minnesota’s Minneapolis campus after the development of what became known as the West Bank began in the early 1960s; also significant for its innovative engineering techniques. It three main spans, which are continuous welded haunched steel girders of 246ft, 315ft, and 246ft; bridge was one of the first in the nation to use A441 high-strength, low-alloy steel in its superstructure, which allowed for the structure to be welded rather than riveted. Bridge is supported by reinforced-concrete piers. Both levels are 74ft wide, the upper pedestrian deck features an enclosed walkway that is 30 ft wide and 8 ft high, extending the length of the bridge. To better integrate the bridge with the surrounding academic buildings on both sides, it features globe street lamps lining each side of the upper deck, railing, integrated staircases, plaza areas at each end of the bridge, and stylistic pedestrian enclosure featuring large glass walls. The design process that led up to the current bridge was begun in 1954 by Ralph Rapson, the recently-appointed Dean of the UMN\'s School of Architecture, who had students analyze the university\'s expansion needs and offer solutions; of 4 proposals presented to the administration in 1955, the one ultimately selected "recommended that the university expand across the Mississippi River with a \'Ponte Vecchio-like bridge\' connecting the existing east campus and a new west campus. Vehicular traffic would be on the lower level and pedestrians above. The lower level would connect with a tunnel on the east riverbank to Oak Street to make the campus free of through traffic." The UMN Board of Regents adopted the West Bank plan in 1957, and East Bank buildings began being designed to anticipate the pedestrian upper level of the bridge; preliminary plans were drawn in 1960, and soon adapted to use the A441 steel which permitted a leaner design. Originally the enclosure was envisioned in the Ponte Vecchio concept as a gallery space that would house bookstalls, information and ticket booths, and various types of exhibits, but was never implemented because the bridge was at its maximum dead-load capacity. Lower deck opened in 1965, upper deck in 1966. Featured in a January 1968 ad (in Progressive Architecture, then the biggest magazine on modernism) for the Mississippi Glass Company, which provided the glazing for the covered walkway which used a quarter-mile "life safe" Polished MISCO Wire (22,300 ft.) for both fire retardance and impact resistance. Designing engineers based in St. Louis (MO); Builder: Walter Giertsen Co.; also referred to by MnDOT as Bridge 9360. Originally a light metallic gray, the bridge was painted the maroon of the University of Minnesota with a gold band on the walkway roof. In the 1970s, the lower glass panes were replaced with wooden panels that were painted by various student organizations. Rehabbed in 2011-13, primarily to accommodate the new Central Corridor Light Rail transit line: 2 lines of Warren trusses were added between the original plate girders and 2 additional pier columns were added to accommodate the additional loads on the bridge; the design was sympathetic and done to minimize visual impacts and maintain the design aesthetic of the original structure.

The 3 blocks it was supposed to span were planned in 1965 as part of $26.8M development with Davidson-Baker Company (now anchored by the Osborn buildings, Northwestern National Bank building, and American National Bank building).

Clark said new lighting, heating, and ventilation methods reduced the window requirements (fewer windows than most schools at the time). The school featured an inner court with a large, indoor carpeted playroom. Six intaglios were carved into the interior concrete block walls, based on original art rendered by the Holland pupils. The original proposal for the new site (Between 15th & 16th Aves NE and between 4th & 6th Sts NE) got pushback from the neighborhood, as it required the demolition of 24 homes, a grocery store, and would\'ve cut-off a portion of 5th St NE: residents were unhappy about "encroaching on an established neighborhood" and the nearby St Mary\'s Russian Orthodox Cathedral claimed that its position 100yds away would cause a disruption of worship services. The Holland and Sheridan Schools PTA (the schools were to be combined) supported the new site, and characterized opposition as older residents. The site was ultimately selected, with some adjustments that kept it between 5th & 6th Sts NE (eliminating the need to block 5th) and bringing it further north on the block (eliminating 25 houses), closer to St. Mary\'s. The plan approved by the Minneapolis School Board in fall 1967 was for 14 classrooms, 2 kindergarten rooms, with a capacity of 520 students. From the sketches, the design was a fairly plain rectangular building from the start. School opened in February 1969.
