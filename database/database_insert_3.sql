',E'1958-59',E'1960 AIA MN Merit Award for the original design, which was completely altered in subsequent remodeling to make it just another forgettable building… The large office and manufacturing complex *was* notable for the office portion\'s patterned concrete block exterior, with a main entrance featuring a floating staircase beneath large square canopy; the office structure also featured eaves on both floor with a slightly complicated pattern crossing rectangles. The actual factory area was faced in concrete slab walls. The 30-acre site had variable topography, sloping down from the highway. The architects approached the solution with a two-level office building with main entrance on the upper floor facing the highway, and the lower level connecting to the one-story manufacturing and warehouse facility (original structure was 200,000sf, remaining land on the north of the property was originally developed into a park and recreation area for employees with a small lake). In explaining the office design, the architects noted it was "constructed with a system of steel beams and purlins for the second floor with a concrete slab spanning between purlins. The roof is long span joists and steel deck. Exterior walls are concrete block, faced with special hollow core concrete masonry units. The exterior office walls are illuminated from the roof edge by a series of spotlights concealed by vari-colored plexiglass panels in redwood frames." The interior was designed to be modular and permit flexibility. For the factory potion, the architects noted “The manufacturing and warehouse spaces were constructed with a system of steel columns and trusses carrying steel joists and a metal deck. The trusses and joists are of the same depth. The exterior walls are 5" thick pre-cast exposed aggregate concrete panels supported at floor and roof structure. These wall panels were cast on the floor slabs and lifted into place." Builder: Watson Const. Co.; Construction costs: $1.2M. The 1960 jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C. Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "The jury particularly liked the way the office is placed on the knoll, giving it a dominant position over the mass of the factory. They also liked the textured quality of the office building, which draws attention to its function but felt that this quality had been perhaps carried too far, especially in the detail of the eaves. The building as a whole is quite handsome but it is regrettable that none of the richness was carried over to the factory, which seems, by comparison, to have been somewhat neglected." By 1980 PAKO was said to be the world\'s largest supplier of photographic, graphic arts, and x-ray processing equipment. The company was sold in 1980 to a group led by Gerard Blohorn. Its retail outlets were sold to Brown Photo in 1981. In 1987 PAKO went through Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Pako Corp. was sold to Cordell Reedy Inc. of Peabody, Massachusetts, in 1992. The office building was expanded to the west in a matching design, the factory was expanded somewhat to the north. At some point the entire exterior (office portion and what was originally the uninspired factory) was turned into a half-baked iteration of a school/medical office design. While the factory portion was mediocre and may have benefited from a change, the alterations to the office portion are proof that just because you can doesn\'t mean you should, as well as a demonstration of how soulless generic designs can be.

Sky-lit entry loggia leading from garage to main entrance; dark-colored wood siding; features a patio-balcony area outside the living/dining area, facing Lake Cornelia. The Doctor had also worked with the architect on the Watson-Sturges Clinic in Richfield (1959); the program for the house took a year to develop. Dickey noted it "was much longer than this phase usually takes because the Sturges were in no hurry and wanted to proceed cautiously; but it illustrates the importance of the design process. The more the architect knows about the people involved and how they want to live, the better able he is to create a shell that will further rather than hinder their needs."  The Sturges wanted a "rustic-modern design" with maximum privacy, four general living areas (living-dining area, kitchen-laundry-family complex, children\'s wing, and a master bedroom-den combo) all on the same level. The clients wanted the house to be unobtrusive from the street, with a central entrance that would enable access to any of the 4 major living areas without needing to pass through the others. The children\'s wing was designed so it could be closed off when the children grew up and left home, without disturbing the rest of the house. Asymmetrical slanted ceilings were used to give the house a rustic charm. Dickey noted that "Sometimes the first offerings are just what the client wants, sometimes there are a few small changes which have to be made, and on occasion he will miss the boat altogether and have to go back and start over again." It took 3 preliminary plans to find the right approach. The main entrance faced a built-in buffet that screened off the living/dining area. The clients wanted to feel private despite the location in a fully developed neighborhood, so all the views from the main living areas face the lake; Mrs. Sturges commented "They [architect & builder] gave us everything we wanted and we love it. We really feel isolated here." The Sturges didn\'t see a need for drapes in their living room due to the privacy. Builder: Bob Chapman.'),

Built in 2 parts: The original sanctuary features a barrel-vaulted concrete-frame church (Hammel & Green, 1958) and runs north-south. The designers noted "This building is the first unit of an extensive master plan which includes a church, office and fellowship and religions education facilities. This unit, now used for worship and Sunday School, will ultimately function as a chapel and fellowship hall within the overall plan. Built of monolithic concrete, this building utilizes thin-barrel vaults as roof system. These vaults are 2⅔" thick. This expression was chosen to harmonize with the pattern of construction that will be used for later phases of the master plan" The firm included the first phase in a monograph of recent work featured in the May-June 1959 issue of Northwest Architect. The 1959 jury comprised Pietro Belluchi (Dean of MIT\'s architecture program), Ronald Gourley (Assoc. Prof, Harvard), and Lawrence B. Anderson (MIT), which commented "A series of six handsome transverse barrel shell vaults enclose a well-proportioned room with simple and pleasing chancel fittings. Perhaps the illumination valances at the window heads are a little clumsy and some delicate suspended or bracketed metal fixture might have given more character to the space. Sunday school rooms are on the lower floor and the circulations scheme centers on the entrance narthex which also gives access to the stairs down. This narthex appears unnecessarily pinched; greater generosity would be desirable here to give a feeling of importance to entering the church." First phase builder: Ridgway Const. Co.; Cost: $80,445.08. Featured as a notable church ahead of the 1960 national conference (in the Twin Cities) of the Church Architectural Guild of America & the Department of Church Building and Architecture of the National Council of Churches of Christ and published in the March-April 1960 issue of Northwest Architect (conference theme "The Modern Church: its Message and its Architectural Challenge"); local architect Gordon A. Schlichting, of Armstrong & Schlichting, was Assistant General Chairman of the conference and noted Minnesota was considered at the time to be "the cradle of the birth of contemporary church architecture in these United States." The second, 1969-70 section (designed by Hammel, Green & Abrahamson (HGA)) added a new square nave on the northeast of the original building, which was remodeled into a fellowship hall and parish building. The new worship space featured a concrete square with sharp triangular point above the altar sat 325; it was dedicated in an ecumenical celebration, inviting the Rabbi of nearby Beth El Congregation and Christian Brother of the Benilde School; HGA\'s Curtis Green presenting the keys. The 1973 jury comprised Winnipeg-based architects Cecil Blankstein (FRAIC), Leslie J. Stechesen (RAIC, later a Fellow), and Etienne J. Gaboury (FRAIC). Second phase builder: Henry T. Peterson & Co.; Cost: $220,000. In 2017 the structure became the Buddhist temple, Wat Promwachirayan (Wat Thai of Minnesota).'),

William "Bill" Boyer (1906-73) had joined the Ford Motor Co. in 1924 after two years of night school at the University of Minnesota out of North High School, working his way as an office boy up to the sales division; he was then moved around the Midwest by the company before returning to the Twin Cities in 1943 to form the Boyer-Gilfillan Motor Co., a Ford distributor, with J.W. Gilfillan (who already operated a Ford dealership since 1927)—Boyer eventually bought out Gilfillan\'s interest (in \'64 it became Bill Boyer Ford) and partnered with Fremont Mitchell (creating Mitchell-Boyer Co.) to handle a wide range of luxury vehicles; he then formed automobile finance and insurance companies. His longest legacy was being a key player in bringing professional sprots to the Twin Cities as a member of the Metropolitan Area Sports Commission: originally aiming at Major League Baseball, he helped lead the bond drive that built Metropolitan Stadium so the Minnesota Vikings could be formed (he was president of the football team for the first 5 years). Later he assisted in bringing the Washington club of the American League to become the Minnesota Twins. Before he died, he was the deciding vote in whether the Vikings would move to a future domed stadium in downtown (the eventual Metrodome). Bill served as president of the Minneapolis Area Chamber of Commerce (1959-61), among other civic organizations. The Boyers had two daughters. He was known for affecting a Southern accent despite never being from there or living there. Bill died of cancer in 1973, age 67.

Rectangular structure that originally increased the class space at what was then called the Minneapolis School of Art by 50%. The design featured a central area (80\'x80’) to serve as a communal classroom with an elevated roof to provide daylight through a four-foot band of clerestory windows. The structure was budgeted between $175k-$200k and also included workshops and graphics department rooms. The exterior walls were designed as a concrete block wall interspersed with glass panels to admit daylight. Builder: Walco Const. Co. Cost: $163,716.33 (general contract). The 1959 Honor Award was credited to "Magney, Setter, Leach, Lindstrom & Erickson" as the firm had been renamed that year. The jury comprised Pietro Belluchi (Dean of MIT\'s architecture program), Ronald Gourley (Assoc. Prof, Harvard), and Lawrence B. Anderson (MIT), which commented "Established now in the modern architectural vocabular is the square self-draining warped-shell umbrella. Structurally complete in itself, each unit needs only lateral restraint from its neighbor. This building shows how admirably this element cam be used to create interior high-bay space with clerestory lighting. Secondary low-ceiling space, lighted by vertical strips in the walls, is assembled around the high central space. It is a simple and powerful idea, and the details in the use of materials are consistent in spirit." The school had become a four-year degree granting institution under the guidance of Director Wilhelmus Bryan (who took the role in 1951-62), at the time of construction the school had 500 students, of whom 220 were regular degree candidates; the Ford Foundation had given the school a $150,000 grant to help the school develop a proper curriculum for independent art schools.

Three square building units originally connected by dramatic glass links connecting to the two separate levels of the classroom wing.

In order to conform to these rolling contours the program area was divided into three separate building units. Unit 1 contains general classrooms grouped around a central court. Unit 2 includes administration, library, cafeteria and special classrooms having varying area or equipment requirements. Unit 3 is windowless and contains the gymnasium, locker rooms and a small theater. The entire group of buildings is surrounded by a perimeter road, providing parking and bus service to all units. An elementary school [Sibley Elementary School], as shown on the site plan, was also constructed at the same time, the construction and materials of which are similar to the junior high school." Hammel & Green included it in a monograph of its recent work featured in the May-June 1959 issue of Northwest Architect. The jury comprised Pietro Belluchi (Dean of MIT\'s architecture program), Ronald Gourley (Assoc. Prof, Harvard), and Lawrence B. Anderson (MIT), which commented "It is advanced work in planning to be able to deal effectively with the teaching spaces required by the many interrelated departments of a modern high school and here the architect has been able to achieve an unusual degree of order. This order results from repetition of a similar building cube, the different cubes cleverly related to each other and the interconnections skillfully managed. Versatility comes in finding a basically different arrangement within each cube. There is some question as to the wisdom of the arrangement which uses all of the outside walls of one cube to light its corridors. In the third unit there may be some conflict in the close juxtaposition of the gymnasium and the auditorium, particularly as affects the easy access of physical education classes to the dressing spaces directly below the auditorium." Builder: Henkel Const. Co. (Mason City, IA); Cost: $2,438,568.48. Impressively, Hammel & Green won an 1959 Honor Award for a different middle school they designed (solo) in Austin, MN (Ellis Junior High School).

Large building for a construction equipment firm that handled sales and service for the Caterpillar Tractor Co. The original footprint (100,000sf) was a long rectangle with two wings of roughly the same size extending to the south; there have been multiple additions, as well as a substantial remodel of the main entrance. Architect Griswold studied a number of equipment company layouts in several part of the country before designing the plant. The new structure was commissioned by the company as demand rose for highway construction and maintenance equipment handled by Ziegler. Prior to moving to this 17-acre site in the south suburbs, the company operated out of the midtown area (2929 University Ave SE); this large site was selected for its direct access to major highways and freeways, room for expansion, and space for parking, storage, and a demonstration area. In their submission to the AIA MN awards, the architects noted "The program to provide offices, shops and warehouse was solved by basically dividing these elements. The office serves both a staff and line connection to this development (there are some five branch sales-service officers) and thus the relationship to both shop and warehouse needed to be rather close for administration of these facilities. The construction was of steel columns, trusses and joists (same depth as trusses) with a poured gypsum roof deck. The walls of the shop structures were of prestressed precast exposed aggregate (5" thick) because of their considerable height (26\'). The warehouse and office elements were walled with concrete masonry. Display is entirely outdoors In the natural environment of earth moving equipment. It seemed a bit ridiculous to display such devices in a highly finished display room. Each display can be set up anywhere on the site (in the entrance court or on the proving grounds to the south of the building complex) as seems most appropriate. This is not impulse buying but rather through demonstration." When initially completed, the million-dollar plant housed shop, warehouse, and offices under one roof and boasted many of the latest developments in structural processes and equipment: it included precast concrete wall units by Prestressed Concrete, Inc. (St. Paul) and 20 Kinnear power-operated rolling steel doors. It had 2 areas of shop space containing 14 work bays, and a special service shop for washing, seam cleaning, and painting. 5 acres of the site were initially for testing and demonstrating construction reequipment. Additions were always envisioned, per the architects in 1960: "The building is planned for expansion in four directions, with the now vacant entrance court to be a large, flexible meeting room to be used for presentation of new equipment, motion picture presentations, classroom sessions, entertainments—all directed toward the customer." Builder: D\'Arcy Leck Const. Co.; construction costs (building-only): $937,206. The 1960 jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C. Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "Particular jury commendation was given to this project for the clean, clear, consistent statement of a factory building type.

Architect John Lloyd Wright (1892-1972) was the son of FLW (and brother of architect Lloyd Wright), who may be best known for inventing the Lincoln Logs toys in 1916. John Lloyd Wright\'s connection to the area was through his third wife, former client Frances L (Gordon) Welch (m.1946), whose brother, Henry Polachek, lived in nearby West Burns Valley: A visit to her brother led to the commission.\n\nThe architect implemented the organic style his father was known for—based on the principle of uniting the structure to its site, its environment, and the persons for whom it is being built, stating "In a few months after it is completed, you\'ll feel that it has always been there." This house uses Winona\'s local travertine stone with horizontal lines to bring it closer to the ground. The unusual roof was Wright\'s answer to the winter cold and heavy snow, which he envisioned as "providing a second wall" for the home. Frances Welch, who was an artist, contributed two murals (on canvas mounted on a heavier base) in the dining room and living room of the Miller house.\n\nThe permit for a 115\'x32\' house with 9-rooms and an attached garage was the most expensive in the city for the year 1953 ($30,000). The permit drew some controversy ahead of being granted: as initial excavations began, a neighbor noted it appeared to violate setbacks from the property lines. The neighbor hired an attorney who noted the design\'s large, six-foot eaves would project beyond the setback line and brought it to the attention of the City Attorney, who agreed. The issue was brought to the City Council, which was forced to reexamine the existing 1940 zoning ordinance, which did not consider eaves of a house in establishing minimum setbacks from property-lines; previously the vertical wall was considered the start of the house. The City Council noted that the wall of the offending side was already 2-feet behind the setback line (thus the eaves project 4-feet past) and the back side of the house design was violating the rear set-back by a total of 6-feet (for a total of 10); it gave Miller the option of having the house redesigned to keep the eaves to 3-feet beyond the setback linse or file a variance (which appeared to be opposed by neighbors). After some further negotiation with the city (and City Attorney) a compromise was reached a week later that avoided the variance: moving the house one-foot west complied with the city\'s newly revised setback restrictions, and met with the approval of the westerly neighbor. Builder: P. Earl Schwab.\n\nBen Miller (1910-2002) took his family\'s Miller Waste Mills and made a fortune in the plastics business, opening the Fiberite Corporation in 1947. "I want to say one word to you, Ben. Just one word. Are you listening? Plastics."\n\nJohn\'s daughter (through his second wife), Elizabeth Wright Ingraham (1922-2013), also became an architect and designed the George and Beth Anderson House, just across the river from Minnesota in Fargo, ND.'),

The first sketch of the initial 10-story segment was presented in January 1950, the estimated $12,000,000 building in the drawing was not too far from the final design. It was planned to more than double the floor space of the existing clinic buildings, and be connected via a broad underground concourse. The capacity of the initial 10-floors was estimated at 150,0000 to 160,000 patient-registrations per year (in 1949 the clinic registered 141,772 patients, but was designed to accommodate only 85,000). Builder: Stocke & Olson. The structure was gradually occupied as completed between 1953-54. Originally 10-stories tall, it was always designed to be able to support an additional 8 floors—indeed the top-8 were added in 1968-69 (the two halves have a clear separation by mechanical floors). Ellerbe\'s art consultant, Warren T. Mosman supervised the Mayo art program and commissioned several large bronze exterior sculptures on the large marble facades and 9 interior murals form artists of national repute, all were created around the humanist ideals with the overall theme of "Mirror to Man:" the east face of the structure has William Zorach\'s "Man and Achievement" (1954), with 4 sculptures depicting man at work in various fields through which he might express his creative drive; the south face of the structure has Abbott Pattison\'s "Man and Recreation," depicting 3 groups representing man at rest and at play; the north side featured Ivan Mestrovic\'s "Man and Freedom" (1954), a 27-foot tall statue of a man with up-stretched arms and face tilting upward (with a strategically placed fig leaf); the statue was moved slightly when the original 1st St (north) side became fully connected to the Gonda Building (1998-2001), but remains in approximately the same place in the new atrium between buildings. Featured in a July 1957 ad (in the Journal of the American Institute of Architects) for the Marble Institute of America, due to its extensive use of a marble curtain wall. Structure now referred to as the "Mayo Building." The site of the structure previously held what was originally the Central School building, but by 1950 was the Mayo Foundation Museum of Hygiene and Medicine; the museum moved "temporarily" to a Quonset hut for 13-years.

The $337,000 structure had more than 1,100 tons of concrete floor and roof slabs: the 9"-thick slabs each measured 85 by 89 feet and weighed 375 tons. Was featured the May-June 1959 issue of Northwest Architect for the use of concrete: it was one of the first buildings in the Upper Midwest to have its roof and floors lifted into position intact by the lift slap method. Erection of the slabs took less than two weeks and welding of the slabs into position on 24 steel columns culminated what was then-considered the unusual part of the project. The slabs were then hoisted by 24 hydraulic jacks perched atop 35ft columns and operated by remote control. The roof was the first to rise, at four feet per hour; when it reached the top it was welded into place and the jacks were reconnected to the floor slap for the process to repeat. The slabs were poured on top of each other in the basement, separated by a thin coat of wax-like plastic to prevent sticking. Architect Griswold noted that: "Savings with Lift Slab stem largely from the fact that it\'s cheaper and faster to build concrete floors on the ground. Scaffolds and many of the forms and wooden structures required with conventional methods are eliminated." In this structure, the savings were estimated at $7,200. The architects also employed another uncommon design technique: the front of the structure originally comprised large 4\'x11\' sheets of translucent plastic separated by aluminum I-beams for strength and appearance: Dead air between the sheets was to serve as insulation, while the plastic\'s translucency was to aid indoor illumination. Floor and roof slabs and perimeter columns extend beyond the face on all sides. It was designed to hold two additional floors if needed (unbuilt). The first floor was designed for laboratory space, the basement for inventory control, and the upper floor for executive offices; the entire structure was designed with 24,000sf. Owner: Benson Optical Co.; Builder: E.M. Ganley Co., Inc. The translucent plastic panels were gone by 2007 and replaced with an ugly opaque surface that completely defeated the purpose of the design. Later converted into religious building, with a transformative face remodel in 2017, though the sides remain as they were, with slabs visible (2020: Life Church).'),

Norman Ridge was initially developed in 1947 on land that was his father\'s farm, as a "country setting for fine country homes. designed and protected to remain that way." The homes designed by Norsen "reflect the contemporary design, modern equipment, spacious open planning, and delightful coloring" with prices from $15,000 to $30,000. Originally 33 lots; As of a Minneapolis Tribune feature on the neighborhood on 04/30/1950, 14 of the first 15 homes were designed by Norsen, who studied mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota. The only non-Norsen house among the first 15 was Close Assoc.\'s Dr. Ruth Boynton & Prudence Cutright House (180 Norman Ridge). In explaining his design philosophy, Norsen stated "One of my basic assumptions is that most men want to keep their wives happy and young. To do it, they need a house that any ordinary woman can take care of herself, and still have time to enjoy other things in life besides housework." His designs were one-level, featured big fireplaces out of aggregate slag blocks (most with raised, cantilevered hearths, grates made of firebrick rather than steel, some that open two-way, and some with brass hoods), big living rooms with open plans and few doors outside of the usual private areas, usually 3 bedroom, plywood paneling instead of plaster, no footings (wood deck built over structural slab of concrete), large double-pane windows with additional use of clerestory windows in living rooms, passive solar heating on the south, accordion doors (especially between children\'s rooms so they can open up for play), tar and gravel roofs (especially on flat roofs).'),

You can\'t handle more than about 30 to 35 patients in a single circle. [. . .] The secret is concentrating actual patient care in the circle. Extra services like the kitchens, teaching space, elevators and the rest are outside this patient circle. So the nurse is not distracted by noise or walking distance normal in a hospital. The circle plan means either better care or fewer nurses--there\'s no question about that."

The program was to expand the physical plant of an overcrowded elementary and high school space and to improve the special HS departments. The site was complicated by the presence of a sinkhole nearby which necessitated extensive footing and foundation installation on the already restrictive site. The result was a major addition adding 8 elementary classrooms, kitchen, cafeteria commons, office space, and home economics and industrial arts for the high school. The new cafeteria commons is topped by a gently folded roof (folded 8 times), with clerestory windows under the folds on both open sides: the lower section of the east side is masonry inset with a smattering of colored glass; it originally had a large glass wall facing the courtyard at the west, but this has been removed from subsequent addition; the interior of the space was a beamed ceiling with wood paneling. The design created a courtyard with the existing school structure; the existing structures include the 1939 stone gymnasium, built through the WPA. In remarks, the architects stated: "To effectively separate the elementary youngsters from the older children, a major addition was made to the existing building to house all elementary grades. Several high school special departments were also included in the addition but these were separated from the elementary section by a cafeteria-common area. Former elementary spaces in the old building were converted to other all high school classrooms. When the existing building reaches total obsolescence it will be demolished and new sections added as needed. The program, in effect, represents a completely new elementary and high school building planned for ultimate replacement of the original, outmoded structure." [it appears the planned replacement never occurred] The 1960 jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C. Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "The jury felt very favorably disposed toward the court, which resulted from the shape and plan of the new building and its relationship to the old, and felt that the cafeteria-common was not only a pleasant room in itself but especially so in its relation to this court. The choice of a somewhat arbitrary façade for the classrooms has questionable results as far as lighting is concerned, for one-half of a given classroom seems to have natural light and the other half seems to be behind a brick wall." The school was later renamed the Kingsland school and closed in 2018; by the 2020s the structure was reopened as the Wykoff Commons Fitness and Recreation center, with fundraising to maintain the buildings (the logo echoes the form of the folded roof).

Shelton of Fayetteville, Arkansas, and licensed through local architect B. J. Knowles & Co. The system was based on hexagonal structure clusters that allowed for easy expansion, inexpensive construction, and (highlighted by its name) the maximization of natural light. Light was increased by the hexagonal wall design, which increased the surface area, with walls implementing a significant amount of light-directing glass blocks, directing the light upward to reduce glare. The hexagonal design also reduced material costs by eliminating wasted space, and allowed for rapid fire evacuation. Maximlite Schools were built across the USA and Canada for a short period ending in the early 1960s (concentrated in the Arkansas/Oklahoma/Missouri region surrounding Fayetteville).

Riedesel) and son (Richard G. Reidesel) lived in an odd-couple pair of neighboring houses of great stylistic difference. George was an architect for Ellerbe & Co. who bought an c.1860 Victorian house built for Swiss flour miller David Stucci in 1943; the elder architect helped his adult son and young family design their modern house next door, which resulted in several clashes of old and new ideas for design: Richard convinced his reluctant father to design in a shed roof (George thought it should be peaked to shed snow better "and was more conventional"). Richard wanted clerestory windows above the main windows—his father said it would cost more to heat, son replied "And they do, but I balance that off against the pleasure I get, better ventilation, natural lighting, and in being able to see right up into the sky." Richard used 7ft studs in bedroom walls rather than 8ft to save money (cutting 14ft studs in half), which he claims did not make the ceilings "too low" like his father was worried about. George thought the kitchen should be cut off from the living-dining room, but both Richard and his wife decided a fan could keep away odors. In the end, Richard\'s father was game about it, chuckling "It\'s the architect\'s job to interpret the wishes of his client." Richard built the house. The house used cork tile floors, save for the bedrooms which used maple parquet; the walls were knotty oak panels; the center of the house is dominated by a large chimney and fireplace (with wide lip of rock creating a seating area around it) made of rough-cut St. Croix Valley rock, which also makes up the patio on the north side of the house and the steps on the south (front) of the house. George then added a few of the elements from his son’s house to his own Victorian: cutting out a wall between the dining room and the parlor and tide the two rooms together with the same color scheme and flooring that "gives it some of the open, friendly feeling that Richard\'s house has." The exterior of Richard’s house, as of 2020, has horizontal wood exterior set on a rough brick lower level including tuck-under garage; Passive-solar features, especially with the south-facing façade with lots of windows, strategic overhangs for deflect summer sun; on the east side is a greenhouse portion which may be a later addition.

The overall design of the house is contemporary, but many of the materials were traditional: the exterior was designed with old brick combined with contemporary redwood vertical siding.

The entry-side of the house is more traditional in style, the lake-front side is more modern, with long windows facing the view. The interior places the living and family rooms side-by-side and separated by a wall with a pair of fireplaces. The house was designed with no drapes, but rather folding caned shutters. The design of the house was planned around crates of Portuguese tile the MacFarlanes brought from a trip to Lisbon; their design featured patterns of peasant figures and scenes in blues, greens, yellows, oranges, and reds on a white background. The tiles were used in the kitchen and countertops/backsplash areas (a blue refrigerator was selected to go with them, and the cabinets were painted to match); the same tile was used in the family room that opened off the kitchen, while also rising the wall between family room and living room and forming part of the fireplace mantlepiece and raised hearth. The rest of the fireplace wall was Tennessee crab orchard stone.
