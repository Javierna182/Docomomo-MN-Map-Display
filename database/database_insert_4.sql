The architect designed much of the furniture, which was built by a cabinetmaker in his local area (Colorado Springs), along with some pieces by Knoll; Ruhtenberg has been called one of the least known but important contributors to the modern movement; David Hanks, a curator at the Stewart Program for Modern Design in New York. described Ruhtenberg\'s role thus: "I can\'t believe how involved he was. Every single step of the way, he is there." Latvian-born, ethnically Swedish, he studied in Germany and initially worked in furniture design before receiving an architecture scholarship at age 32 and apprenticed under Mies van der Rohe at the Bauhaus, working and collaborating with a young Philip Johnson in Germany; he later moved to NYC, Henry-Russell Hitchcock thanked him for "reading and criticizing" his and Johnson\'s important 1932 book "The International Style: Architecture Since 1922" published in conjunction with the associated exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art where Hitchcock and Johnson were curators; he also contributed to Johnson\'s noted "Machine Art" exhibition at MoMA; after Johnson left to go pursue Fascism in Germany, Ruhtenberg taught at Columbia for a few years and eventually moved to Colorado in 1940.

Mr. Peterson was an admirer of Frank Lloyd Wright, as can be noted by the very modern design and many windows, especially the back of the house, which faces Glen Creek, and is 90% glass.

Entry flooring is travertine rock, and original flooring throughout was cork. Notice the home\'s roof extends and connects with the roof of the garage, creating a covered breezeway. This was apparently to get around a zoning ordinance that called for all garages to be attached to the house. When the 1965 Fridley tornadoes demolished all of the surrounding homes, Mr. Peterson made his fortune by design/building most of the homes in the neighborhood. Our front office still has a tiered rack on the wall for blueprints. A large deck with gazebo overlooks Glen Creek, and the property line runs all the way into the creek.

Notes for its use of native granite prairie stone, exquisite concrete shapes, and the interplay of light and shadow. Designed and built in phases due to the limited financial means of the sisters. The first buildings were a convent, dining hall, and classroom, built in 1958-59. Phase II (1961-63) consisted of the convent wing, chapel and bell tower; the second phase used St. Cloud-based Traynor & Hermanson (who were previously associated architects on St. John\'s projects). Based on the requests of the Sisters, these buildings were arranged around three large open courtyards, with circulation patterns of their religious order determining placement of the individual wings and their connecting walkways. Designed to be low to the ground so only the bell tower rose high: The iconic, hundred-foot Bell Banner (1962) bell tower is the complex\'s symbol, landmark and belfry--it sits on an axis with the chapel--in Breuer\'s words "From afar, the bell tower makes a distinctive silhouette in the otherwise fairly empty landscape, and from nearby marks the approach to the chapel." The chapel roof consisted of half-hyperbolic-paraboloid concrete shells, a form Breuer had begun to explore with the roof of the library at Hunter College. Part of a major 1964-65 national traveling exhibition of religious architecture, "Churches and Temples: Postwar Architecture," that launched at the Pepsi-Cola Gallery in NYC (it was located at 500 Park Ave) sponsored by the New York Chapter AIA and nationally by the American Federation of Arts, which featured 2 Breuer designed out of 21 selections (the other was his St John\'s Abbey Church ...coincidentally Breuer was on the selection committee, along with Lathrop Douglass, Percival Goodman, P/A Editor Jan C. Rowan, and editor of Editor of Liturgical Arts, Maurice Lavanoux), the catalog noted "In this age, we can no longer profitably repeat past styles, but must find concepts for houses of worship that are meaningful for congregations of today and tomorrow."

He and his wife, Dorothy, initially wanted to build the same house in Rochester, but could not find an identical lot, so--per contemporary newspaper reports--they employed the same firm to design a similar design on a new lot on a high point with a good view. Dorothy initially commented (April 1950) "There may be just one difference: One wing of the second house may have to be built at a different angle because of the shape of the lot we\'ve now got in mind." On her ideas for new houses, she further noted "I tried to erase all of the headaches I\'d ever had in keeping house. Actually, I don\'t particularly like keeping house so my main idea was to make the home as functional as possible. Three weeks of living in our new home [Golden Valley] here has proved we succeeded, so we\'ll just start over again with the same plans." By January 1951, they realized the design would need to depart more from their Golden Valley home due to the lot, however Dorothy Blackmun thought it would be interesting to see a new design under construction. At the time their Golden Valley home was included in a national book on home design, they were reportedly even more happy with their new Rochester house.

The Brainerd-based firm was able to obtain the commission through principal James H. McNutt, a former member of the 115-year-old congregation. McNutt said "The design endeavors not to follow time-worn solution, but to anticipate the needs of the new day. As religion is speaking in the language of today, this design becomes the expression of faith today, creating an atmosphere to bring the individual more readily into relationship with God and his fellowmen." Church complex consists of worship center that rises above the adjacent low, flat-roof facilities wrapping around two sides and forming a small courtyard on the west side ("an area of quiet reverence" per McNutt) and a front court on the south with a delicate tower at center, made of three legs symbolizing the Christian Trinity. McNutt described "The front court, or atrium, is the place of composure for worship upon entering and the place of companionship after service. The atrium contains the tower reaching upward, symbolic of Christian aspiration." A large social auditorium in the building was named Lucas Hall, after a congregant who bequeathed several-hundred thousand dollars to what became the new church. The focal point of the worship center is an illuminated cross just beyond the chancel; the nave seats 340 with an additional 65 in the balcony. Decorative screens sit outside of the stained-glass windows of the worship hall. On using a contemporary style, McNutt explained: "Over the years, plan requirements, materials, techniques have changed to the extent that it is no longer feasible, even if we desired, to force today\'s functions into preconceived forms. Today, church architecture must capture the principles that give greatness to the churches of the past without subservience to traditional plans and forms. To emulate the past for its own sake is to repudiate what is important in the spirit of today." The cost for remodeling and expanding their previous home (b.1919) was estimated at $332,000 with new construction being $425,000.

Tastefully and sympathetically updated and restored by Close Architecture principal, Gar Hargens. Part of the Norman Ridge neighborhood, developed by local builder Robert Norsen, whose Norsen Company was responsible for notable Bloomington mid-century neighborhoods of Norman Ridge and Glen Wilding. Norman Ridge was initially developed in 1947 on land that was his father\'s farm, as a "country setting for fine country homes. designed and protected to remain that way." Originally 33 lots, as of a Minneapolis Tribune feature on the neighborhood (04/30/1950), 14 of the first 15 homes were designed by Norsen, who studied mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota. This was the only non-Norsen design among the first 15. It was included in abbreviated listings of Close Assoc. works in the Spring 1952 issue of "Everyday Art Quarterly," produced by the Walker Art Center. Ruth E. Boynton (1896-1977) was a physician, researcher, and administrator who spent almost her entire career at the University of Minnesota, where she worked in public health and student health services starting in 1921 and served as Director of the University Student Health Service from 1936-61; it was renamed the Boynton Health Service in her honor in 1975. Prudence Cutright (d.1974) was a high-profile educator in the Twin Cities: rising to be acting superintendent of Minneapolis schools, was later an associate professor of education at Macalester College; her progressive views resulted in some baseless accusations she was a Communist during her unsuccessful attempt to be named to the University of Minnesota Board of Regents in 1953 (the accusations resulted in a forceful defense of Cutright from The Minneapolis Star, which did not support her bid for unrelated reasons). Boynton enjoyed cultivating flowers, vegetables, and a pet Weimaraner; she also did home repairs (she took vocational classes in high school) and enjoyed golf. The couple semi-retired to Miami, where Boynton worked as secretary-treasurer of the American College Health Association. Boynton had three custom homes designed; the first was "early American design" (2738 River Pkwy W (1939)), then the contemporary house in Norman Ridge, and finally the couple\'s last house in Coral Gables, Florida (designed for the enjoyment of "outdoor living with a large patio").

Hill; build with 30 classrooms, labs, shops, library, gymnasium and cafeteria with a structure cost of $858,000 (before a planned residence for the Brothers). The initial design followed the "Maximlite School" system developed (and patented in 1956) by Thayer Ewing (T.E.) Shelton of Fayetteville, Arkansas, and licensed through local architect B. J. Knowles & Co. This design was previously used two other local Catholic high schools: all-boys Benilde High School (1956, run by the Christian Brothers of the St. Louis (MO) province), and its all-girls partner school, St. Margaret\'s Academy (1959-60). The system was based on hexagonal structure clusters that allowed for easy expansion, inexpensive construction, and (highlighted by its name) the maximization of natural light. Light was increased by the hexagonal wall design, which increased the surface area, with walls implementing a significant amount of light-directing glass blocks, directing the light upward to reduce glare. The hexagonal design also reduced material costs by eliminating wasted space, and allowed for rapid fire evacuation. Maximlite Schools were built across the USA and Canada for a short period ending in the early 1960s (concentrated in the Arkansas/Oklahoma/Missouri region surrounding Fayetteville). The design was popular for its low cost, at Benilde, initial costs were considerably lower (initially $8.53 per square foot, with an average that reduced to $8 per sf after an add\'n) than other high schools in the region. Funds to build the all-boys Hill HS were raised through the Archbishop High School drive begun in 1956. Merged with all-girls Archbishop Murray High School in 1971 to become coeducational (the resulting Hill-Murray school continued to be owned by the Benedictine Sisters of St. Paul\'s Priory), and moved onto that campus (a little bit east at 2625 Larpenteur Ave E).

In 1963 it was purchased by Gerst Funeral Chapels, Inc. and altered and converted to a funeral chapel (Builder: Arkay Builders). The funeral home vacated the premises in March 1968, and it suffered an arson fire in October 1968. In March 1969, the boarded up and still-fire damaged building was occupied by 20 students from Augsburg College (along with house parents) as a part of "Crisis Colony II," an attempt to explore the "urban crisis" for 10 weeks under the auspices of the university and the youth division of the American Lutheran Church (latter under the department of experimental ministries director Rev. Ewald "Joe" Bash); the program gave students 12-15 credits with the community as the teacher. The week preceding they spent the first week of the course in the vacant Kenesseth Israel Synagogue across the street, but moved to the mortuary after concerns voiced by members of the congregation objected to them living and sleeping in a sacred place. The City of Minneapolis attempted to evict the students almost immediately, based on the opinion of the Minneapolis Fire Prevention Bureau and the fact it was not designed for human occupancy; the students and Rev. Bash resisted, seeking the help of the Minneapolis Tenants Union. After a subsequent, detailed inspection by 4 city housing inspectors (led by the deputy inspector Sol J. Jacobs), the city\'s inspection department concluded that the charge by the fire marshal that the building was structurally unsafe was untrue, and granted a 10-day reprieve. Jacobs noted earlier mistakes made (by agreeing with the fire dept. without an independent inspection, "I\'ve learned a lesson") and noted that it was effectively going to last for the full length of the 10-week Crisis Colony II. Jacobs conceded that, in permitting it, he overlooked housing code violations (lack of windows in sleeping quarters) and asked for some fire safeguards be added (installing extinguishers, removing cardboard from walls scorched in the previous fire, modifying doors for use as fire escapes). The students, meanwhile, drew the attention that the conditions of the building they were occupying were far inferior to the living conditions of many families on the North Side, and felt it was hypocritical: "Why doesn\'t the inspection department act against landlords who allow these conditions?" In an awkward turn, the students needed to seek help from the 5th Ward alderman Joe Greenstein (he was known as "Pumpkin Joe" from his job as a grocer) to get a special permit, though many of them were campaigning against him. Greenstein then vindictively attempted to have the students evicted by City Council action, only to be defeated by a 7-t0-3 vote and denounced by other Council members as an attempt to turn the issue into something political in his reelection. By 1969 it was purchased and renovated by the Minnesota Assemblies of God, which dedicated it as a new, urban parish in January 1970. By 1975 it was the Trinity Tabernacle, which commissioned a major add\'n in 1995, developing the west side of the property where a house once stood; the alterations have remodeled the exterior of the original, eastern portion.'),

The L-shaped cabin that hugs the edges of the peninsula, the shape allows it to open to the outside surrounding, flooding morning to evening light through its rooms; ventilating cross winds off the lake, with a view of Lake Vermilion in every window. The western end of the structure contains the library, featuring a walk-out deck over water; the other end (southern) is a bedroom. The structure uses an abundance of redwood: The exterior walls are all heart redwood, horizontally tiered, and fastened to the frame with hand driven brass screws. The interior rooms use angled or vaulted ceilings using exposed clear redwood joists. The two outer bedrooms are connected to the main cabin wing through an enclosed breezeway, which itself serves as one of the five "conversation areas" envisioned for Thunderhead by Lisl Close. Commissioned by Gerald (Jerry) A. Hill, a University of Minnesota professor in the General College, on property owned by, or shared with, Richard O. Conrad. Conrad had previously built a log cabin, which exists today, just east of the peninsula (facing the modern workshop) during the 1930s. Jerry Hill lived with two other bachelors, Edwin Zeigfield and Ray Faulkner in the Closes\' celebrated 1938 Lippincott House (252 Bedford St SE), establishing an early relationship with Lisl and Win Close. Hill, Zeigfield and Falkner were collaborators on the modern encyclopedic textbook of art history, "Art Today." Original furniture includes designs by Hans Wegner, Torben Strandgaard, and France & Daverkosen – as well as built-in benches, cabinets and bookshelves by Lisl Close. The design evolved considerably from when it was originally planned in the late 1930s: an early design included a power plant on site as there was no electricity available at the time on that section of north shore. There are no roads that service the peninsula on the North shore of Lake Vermillion, so access is only by boat from the South shore. All building materials, appliances and furniture for the cabin were ferried to the peninsula using an old army barge, which was subsequently scuttled in the lake. Adapted in part from "Thunderhead on Vermillion" (Copyright © John Boelter), used with permission. The cabin is only accessible by boat, so the address is not reflective of its location, which is at 47°54\'39.7"N 92°33\'45.2"W (47.911035132542736, -92.56254740750873).

Dean, Jr. in Weston, MA. Much of the savings were realized through efficient, space-saving room arrangements; for example, the use of sliding doors, and a "well-defined dining area" was created by fireplace wall. It also involved siting the house with trees to shade the southern exposure in summer but not shut out winter sun. On roofs, Koch felt "Though sloping roof restricts planning more than a flat one, we find that by using modern but conventional construction, a sloping roof is less expensive. For economy, we like to keep the roof pitch pretty low, particularly when the climate will let us use a modified rolling-roof type surface." Glass was used "to bring into rooms all possible sunlight and to open the most expansive view toward the pleasantest parts of the lot." The garage and workshop areas are placed closest to the street to minimize snow-shoveling. The McNulty version appears to have some modifications, unclear if they were done during initial construction or by subsequent renovations/remodeling, however it appears to retain much of the overall plan. Described in its 1957 real estate listing as a "contemporary bi-level with natural redwood siding, long, sweeping gables, [and] pecky cypress den."

Company president Lloyd Hale saw benefits to its employees, and was also a proponent of smart planning: "We feel that it is a very healthy thing to have the place of work close to where the employees live," though cautioned that suburban plants must be surrounded by buffer strips of tree, shrubs, and lawns to make living close to the plant attractive so it thus "enhances property values in a community because employees who seek to live near a plant will bid up the price of land." He also cited the popular thinking of the mid-1950s, that there would be fewer traffic problems (spread-out plants would lead to fewer traffic bottlenecks), expenses, and a more congenial working atmosphere: "Most of us spend more of our waking hours at the job than at home. It should be a place where it is good to be."

The strategy of hospital construction was guided by the United Hospital Fund of Minneapolis and Hennepin County (UHF), formed in 1955 for regional planning, which provided $2.4M towards the project (among others); additional funds were provided through Hill-Burton federal aid and fundraising. It was the first hospital completed under the UHF. Constructed with reinforced concrete columns, brick, and porcelain insulated enameled panels, the structure was designed in an off-set cross on a rectangular base, it was original 5-stories, with several stories added later. Operating rooms and other clinical services were on the ground floor; basement tunnels connected it with the existing St. Barnabas buildings, including the heat, power, and laundry facilities, as well as a nursing dormitory. The design of the upper floors was to allow two nursing stations to handle the needs of patients; the "core" design with "step-saving" "central corridor control plan" was an advertising point in the hospital\'s ads for additional personnel. The main entrance featured floor-to-ceiling glass curtain walls and aluminum panels; the lobby contained a visitors\' lounge with flame-treated cherry wood paneling. It was the first hospital in the Twin Cities to have piped oxygen, suction, and nitrous oxide to all operating and delivery rooms. It included a chapel with a capacity for 60 wheelchair patients.

The original plan was for a 5-phase construction program (initially planned to total 336,000sf) to wrap up in 1964-65, beginning with a main "stem" structure to contain basic research and flour milling research laboratories. Wings were designed to be added for food technology, physics, administrative offices, analytical research, cafeteria, power house, shop, warehouse, etc. General Mills planned the new facility, expanding on their existing Central Research Laboratories at 2010 East Hennepin facility, to permit them to explore new areas "not only in food but in other areas." Secrecy was important to General Mills research due to perceived lack of patentability on products (and the importance of being first to the market). The campus-like facility was designed for 500 scientists and associated workers. The large, rectangular property totaled 112-acres, though only the lower 48.8 acres was developed. Sited roughly a mile north of the new-completed General Mills General Office (1956-58) by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. When company founder James Ford Bell died on May 7, 1961 (he was also its first president and board chairman), that same month the company named the complex after him and cited his role "as a moving force behind the company\'s research activities." Bell emceed the cornerstone-laying and "topping-out" ceremony on March 10, 1960; a tree was raised to the highest point of the building to mark completion of the steel framework of the first unit. The first phase, totaling 74,255sf, was completed in December 1960 (Builder: D\'Arcy-Leck Const. Co.). The second phase of construction, adding 170,030sf, was greenlit in May 1961, for completion in 1962 (Builder: M.A. Mortenson Const. Co.); the second phase added a structure to the southern tip of the original phase, and then a substantial portion to the north end (adding more spine flanked by one wing off to the east, then a double east/west wing beyond that on the then-northern terminus); this $1.5M second phase included a food development lab wing, food engineering wing, cafeteria, warehouse, shops, and major extensions of the central office stem.

The article noted how 2-bedroom houses like this, mass-produced after WW2 to house returning veterans, did not anticipate the large families many would have in the Baby Boom. After purchasing the then-new house in 1950, the Gerrishes had two children and wanted more space; they liked the neighborhood and proximity to the school and shops. Taking advantage of the corner lot, Gerrish designed a 15\'x25\' addition to the back of the house to act as a new living room with dining area, as well as moving the front entrance to the addition; this allowed the original living room to become a bedroom, and the original dinette to be absorbed as more kitchen space. The new living room featured a large fireplace built of granite paving blocked pried out of the Minneapolis streets when the old streetcar tracks were taken out. Those same paving blocks were used to create an entry and to balance off the fireplace. The new living room was paneled in cherry plywood and floor surfaced with squares of quarry tile; the ceiling was vaulted with timber cross beams. Architect Harry E. Gerrish, Jr. was son of a successful HVAC engineer; Harry, Sr. (d.1953) was president of Morgan Gerrish Co. Alas, as of a 2017 sale, the interior has been utterly gutted and redone in the blandest manner imaginable (though they didn\'t manage to ruin the fireplace stones).'),

It is in effect a complete hospital by itself, except that it does not propose caring for the patients beyond from four to six months. The effort is made to give the new patient every chance at a cure. In designing the nursing units, the architects recognized that mental patients are, for the most part, ambulant and in need of ample areas for recreation and occupation; also for relaxation when the patients are not under a specific scheduled therapy." The facility included large out-patient treatment areas that were removed from the in-patient areas, and allowed availability to both out- and in-patient care without cross-circulation. Facilities were provided for men and women, as well as patients facing various conditions and diagnoses. '),

Prior to that he had the former Bismarck Theater pipe organ in 1950, but in 1958 he obtained and installed a 1,480 Wurlitzer organ (build 1927) that weighed 12 tons. To accommodate it, in 1960 he added a 4,000sf room he called his amusement room; it could fit pipes up to 16ft tall and had a carved relief by Bismarck artist Rosemary Landsberger taken from the old Grand Pacific Hotel. The living room ceiling featured wood beams from the old Willis grade school, and a suspended staircase leading to a flat-topped roof. Featured in as one of "Bismarck\'s Top 10 Homes" in a feature in The Bismarck Tribune (11/01/1980). The Delzers would host organ concerts and other special events at the home. The exterior was originally a mix of brick and wood siding on a stone base. Typical for the era. In a 1980 interview, Dezler noted: "I laid it out myself 30 years ago. I laid it out for my family. Now they\'ve grown up and gone and I\'m a widower, but I\'m going to stay here anyway. I\'ve got everything here I like—antiques, a big pipe organ. It\'s just perfect." Delzer was a contractor who learned homebuilding from his father, and founded Delzer Construction doing lots of civil engineering projects throughout the Dakotas, Montana, and Minnesota. After he died, The Bismarck Tribune did a feature on the house and the spectacular organ as his sons put the house on the market.

The eastern half of the house is for living areas and garage (projecting forward from the house), and the southern-facing side features a wall of windows with a bold, timber design that frames it and projects forward several feet to act like passive solar overhangs for both it and the level below (forming a covered walkway). The roof on the eastern half of the house is flat on the framed living room section, and a very low pitch shed roof on the rest. The roof overhangs the garage on all 3 sides that project from the house, creating covered walkways to side-door and main door, as well as providing some overhang on the front of the garage doors. This house is as complicated in person as it is to describe. Thomas S. "Tom" Kleppe (1919-2007) was a prominent politician in North Dakota: While this house was built, he was mayor of Mayor of Bismarck from 1950-54, his private career was as president and treasurer of the Gold Seal Company from 1946-64. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1964 but lost to incumbent Quentin Burdick, however he served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1967-71 before losing to Burdick again in the 1970 Senate race. He then served as Administrator of the Small Business Administration (1971-75) under the Nixon Administration and then Secretary of the Interior (1975-77) under Gerald Ford. '),

General contractor duties were ultimately split between three firms: the initial steel frame was done by William Kirchmeier, but work on enclosing the upper three stories with Hebron face brick and adding the bands of windows was done by Meisner-Anderson Co.; Cowan obtained entirely new bids for completing the fifth (already enclosed) floor, hiring Donald Johnson. Cowan (1880-1956) died in a car accident in September 1956. High risk was taken when installing the steel pillars meant to support the new addition, per a notice in the 07/23/1954 issue of The Bismarck Tribune: "Officials at Cowan\'s say that the only firm which would insure the building against damage during the placement of the pillars was Lloyd\'s of London, and they wanted a premium of $1,100 for ever day the work was in progress. So Cowan\'s and Kirchmeier went ahead without any insurance and accomplished the ticklish job without any damage." The building stayed partly occupied during much of construction (including doctors\' offices on the second floor) so a significant portion of construction was done after normal business hours and at night.

The 1917 Mandan High School, designed by Gilbert R. Horton, was built to the east of the 1900 building and now sits on the northeast corner; its original, southern-facing entrance is now connected to a subsequent wing. In 1924 a second, initially unattached building was constructed to the south and designed by Eugene H. McFarland; the 1917 building became a junior high school. Both the 1917 and 1924 phases were in the Tudor-Revival and Collegiate Gothic style. Modern additions came in 1954, 1966, and 1977. The 1954 addition is a two-story brick and concrete structure on a raised basement with flat roof designed by Foss & Co. (which also designed the new Mandan Senior High School at this time); this wing was initially planned as an elementary school addition, with specific design credited to architect Magnus O. Foss, Sr. (Builder: J.E. Kreig & Co. (Fargo)). The exterior is brick, concrete, and glass. The eastern face is separated into four bays divided by columns of brick; concrete spandrels separate the windows. The classroom windows on the 1954 wing show a classic design of the era: the upper two-thirds of the window spaces are prismatic glass blocks that aim light up and off the ceiling to spread it evenly, and the bottom is a ribbon of clear windows for view. The 1954 addition connected the 1917 and 1924 buildings; the upper levels were classrooms with a large cafeteria space and kitchen in the basement. The 1966 addition is a comparatively small boiler room, attached to east (back) of the 1917 structure. 1976-77 addition designed by Ritterbush Associates provided classrooms for science, special education, and vocational studies in a one-story wing on the west side, and gymnasium attached to the northwest corner of the 1917 building (Builder: Lunn Const. Co.); the exterior of the classroom wing has red and yellow bricks set in a running bond, punctuated by window bays with a large, fixed window with two operable windows below it and decorative concrete spandrels above and below each of them, and the windowless gymnasium was a combination of yellow and red brick set in a running bond; the project was part of a $800,000 package along with simultaneous additions to the senior high school, and lead by architects Robert H. Ritterbush & Merlin E. Rudrud. It became Mandan Junior High School after the completion of the new Mandan Senior High School in 1958. The school moved to a new campus in 2009 and the building was closed. The building, including the 1954 and 1966 modern additions above, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 2017 (the 1977 addition was noted to "lie outside of the period of significance but do not detract from the integrity of the site." They had not yet crossed the 50-year threshold). The gymnasium portion of the 1977 addition was subsequently removed and the rest of the building was converted into the Historic Apartments On 4th, comprising 39 apartment homes for low to moderate income households. The exterior condition of the addition is remarkably good, retaining the glass block prism windows and clear view windows below. '),

During its dedication on August 25, 1961, U.S. Rep. Clark MacGregor noted that fellow Rep. Walter H. Judd saved the building project several times when it was threatened with "bureaucratic death." The primary southern façade is broken into 8 bays by vertical pilasters of dark granite; the east and west facades are broken into 6 bays; the bays are crossed by alternating ribbon bands of dark windows and light granite panels; the lowest level is a dark granite base. Interior originally housed three courtrooms on the sixth floor, with offices for agencies serving the courts and other federal agencies occupying the rest of the building. Developed by the federal General Services Administration (GSA) in conjunction with the local Capital Long Range Improvements Committee (CLIC). Building was delayed by inflation and rising construction costs. Designed as a collaboration between two Minneapolis firms. Builder: Ring Const. Co. Funds ($5,877,000) were appropriated by the U.S. Congress in July 1955. When its location was announced in August 1955, it was expected to take up two-thirds of the entire block bounded by 3rd & 4th streets, Marquette & 2nd Ave S. Plans were to finance the costs by private investment under a lend-purchase contract, with the government authorizing an interest rate up to 4% (with hopes of no more than 3%). The original plans were to have the building ready for occupancy in May 1958. The GSA\'s preliminary architectural ideas envisioned as a 5- or 6-story building with two basements (one being a garage), stone-faced, set back approximately 20-feet from sideways with a primary front facing Marquette Ave. After unsuccessful negotiations between GSA and landowners, condemnation proceedings took over 9 parcels in what was part of the Gateway Center district in July 1956. By October 1956 the plans for the proposed building were "cut in half" to take only half of the site originally contemplated after discussions between F. Moran McConahie, federal Commissioner of Public Buildings of the GSA in Washington, the Minneapolis GSA officials, federal judges, Minnesota members of the U.S. Congress, and Thorshov & Cerny; the other half was instead to be used as a parking lot for employees; at this point expected occupancy was "probably in 1958 or 1959." Plans were greatly slowed in 1957 when the GSA suspended its lease-purchase program as an anti-inflationary move, postponing 98 projects nationwide including this one; pushes by Minnesota\'s Congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator and former governor Edward John Thye, kept the building from being canceled as plans "will proceed to the extend of site negotiations and the architectural design of the buildings." Concern over the delays led Minneapolis Alderman Norman E. Stewart to suggest the city issue bonds to help finance construction; this process would have required authorization by the state legislature, and did not gain traction; instead, construction start was delayed, as expected, to 1959. By August 1957, the budget authorized by Congress in July 1955 dealt with a ~15% increase in construction costs. In November 1957, Rep. Judd was noted for carefully shepherding the project to assure it would eventually be completed. Approved by the GSA in February 1958. First concrete was poured in April 1959.

The house reflects the affluence and, as described by The Minneapolis Star, the family\'s "considerable panache." The split-level is on a choice lot on Twin Lakes, opening up to over 130-feet of lakefront in the back yard. The entrance brings you to a central hall with two stories of windows facing the lake. The exterior is redwood siding with some stone accent. The house has received some updates (appear to be from the early 1980s, using very trendy styles from that era), but kept a decent portion of the interior and exterior mid-century charm. It still includes numerous original built-ins; much of the window and door hardware is unique and charming; the kitchen is still in the original layout with cabinets that may be repainted originals. The owners were the primary designer, working with the engineer of a design-build firm: Arkay Construction Co. The den sits on the highest level with large openings to the main living rooms (originally with shutters that have since been removed); the den has a small wet-bar hidden in the cabinets, and built in book/magazine display racks. The shades of the den include small metal lions with rings (like mini-doorknockers). The master bedroom looks down on the main living area through a partially-stained glass window (somewhat Wrightian design); there are two other bedrooms in the bedroom wing. The master bedroom was designed with a large walk-in closet that passes through to a bathroom. The original shared bathroom for the other bedrooms was later expanded (taking up some of one of the two children\'s bedrooms). All the baths in the house appear to have been remodeled in the early-1980s and reflect the trendy styles of the time; the TV room/family room also appears to have been restyled at that time, as does the laundry/utility room. The house also has what was a dark room and is now a project room with attached bath. There was an expansive built-in bar next to the TV room/family room which partially remains, though it was partly removed to allow for a piano in the space. The TV room/family room and double-height living room are separated by a 2-sided fireplace (originally wood, now gas) and the waterfall pours into a basin in the double-height living room that goes through a tunnel under the fireplace and into a small section in the family room! The main patio off the double-height living room was enclosed at some point (c.1980s?) and the room extended outward that way on the first floor with the position of the original loggia forming the roofline. The patio originally had an outside, built-in barbecue area but it was removed and the stonework on the exterior (and fireplace) was changed to a stacked stone that no longer matches the interior stonework. The house is in overall good condition in 2023. Contemporary newspaper articles make it very clear the Grossmans had firm ideas about what they wanted designed and just went to the St. Louis Park-based firm to realize it and make sure it was buildable. Arkay was founded in 1955 by Julius M. Rivkin & Jack Y. Kahn (both engineers); Kahn\'s name signed off on the blueprints. It was built quickly; it does not appear in a May 1957 aerial image (just a dirt lot flanked by the houses to the north and northeast; house to the south not built until 1972). It was already occupied by November 1958 when a classified ad ran for housekeeper. Chester Vernon Grossman (1923-2017 in Boca Raton, age 93) was a WW2 vet with 33 missions in the Army Air Force, owned Allweather Roof Co., and parent company to Security Alarms Inc.

Like much of this neighborhood, they were part of the vibrant Jewish community that moved in from primarily North Minneapolis. The kitchen was featured in the June 22, 1960 issue of The Minneapolis Star, it was very purple (no longer). The family featured in a Barbara Flanagan article in The Minneapolis Star (May 1967) about their family safari to Africa where Chester killed a cheetah and a daughter was attacked by a zebra. The Star also did a photo feature of the kids having a whipped cream battle on June 28, 1967. Another article in the Star (January 14, 1972) was about Charlotte\'s tennis playing and their family\'s "considerable panache."

Ray would use politicians from both major parties to help advertise the milk, though his connections to Hubert Humphrey (from mayor of Minneapolis, to Vice President of the United States, and onward) actually became a factor in the latter\'s 1968 presidential campaign when unsubstantiated accusations were made that Ray had provided lakeside property in Waverly, MN; he also reportedly helped get former Republican Gov.

Architect Warn (who also designed the additions made in the 1960s) had just served as an apprentice for FLW at Taliesin (this was his first independent commission), and FLW\'s sense of "you are what you live" was attractive to the Harts. The house was designed to grow out the terrain and point towards Duluth\'s harbor (now obscured by trees). The initial design relied on solar heat to keep the upper level warm; the lower level was always a walk-out. The top floor comprised a small hallway, modern kitchen, half-bath, and dining areas. A fireplace was at the center of the home. The dramatic living room had a narrow wrap-around porch (since removed). The initial downstairs was a large bedroom, smaller rom for their baby, Aethan, utility room, and a full bath. The design used a then-fairly novel stacked washer-dryer using a metal rack. The corner windows on both levels brightened the space. The interior walls were originally plastered to contrast with the redwood finishes of the woodwork (as well as the exterior). The original design gave the house the neighborhood nickname of the "Chicken Coop" after Avon installed wire fencing below the deck railing to keep his infant son from falling through. Avon owned an audio-visual store and Viola was an artist. Viola died in 1984, Avon in 1995, and the house sold twice.

The firm noted "the new church was intended to accommodate an old congregation with an active and varied program and to minister also to the university students. The church is an attempt to do many things and also to say many things. The quality of stability and strength was sought by masses of limestone masonry, a local material, used structurally. To avoid the sense of a repelling bastion and to suggest friendliness and grace, as well as to meet the limited budget, wood is also used both as finish and structure. The building attempts to characterize the Christian\'s community as humble, straightforward and unostentatious but not shy or retreating. The extensive use of clear glass was meant to imply that there is a strong sense of the relationship between community and the world, which is particularly apt in this congregation which has assumed a leadership in the social problems in the city. The worship focuses on both the scripture and the liturgical rites and the heritage of formal freedom which characterizes the Baptist church made it possible to plan for worship which is flexible both to create new patterns and to recover old ones."

Peter Dohmen (1904-77) was a well-known and highly accomplished German liturgical modern artist who produced significant stained-glass windows and mosaics; he was responsible for projects at hundreds of church, college, university, and hospitals. He moved to St. Paul from Germany in late-1951 with his wife and two sons. Their lives were upended by the highly questionable killing of their 27-year-old son, Volker H. Dohmen, on May 19, 1964 at his Long Beach apartment by plainclothes police officers: Volker had been living in the area to represent the firm on the West Coast; on the night in question he was at a bar with his fiancée Sharlene Di Donato when they argued with other patrons and left. A bar patron, who had been arguing with Volker, saw him push Di Donato into his car and called police to report a kidnapping (a claim she denied). Plainclothes police went to Volker\'s apartment at 2am, and a neighbor said police did not identify themselves as police officers. Volker, who possessed a gun, thought the men with guns were associated with the men they argued with at the bar and denied them entry; he fired two shots out of the apartment window to try and dissuade the officers as they started breaking into his apartment and firing. 6 different neighbors called the police. Neighbors reported Volker cried out "My god, I\'m hit! Call the police. Somebody please call the police." Apparently wounded, Volker jumped 20-feet from the window and began running. Neighbors reported 30 shots were fired during this part of the incident. Volker first stopped at a community pool with his arms raised, but—upon seeing a group of uniformed policemen near a marked police car—he ran towards them while clearly unarmed, with his arms upraised, dressed only in his undershorts. The police yelled "halt or I\'ll shoot" and then killed him in a volley of fire that struck him with 4 pistol shots and 2 shotgun blasts. His fiancée was falsely told Volker had broken his arm and was in the hospital as the police tried to get their stories straight. A jury ruled the killing was a "justifiable homicide" while "resisting lawful arrest." The family then hired private investigators who took witness interviews that filled in the full account of the killing, including that Volker was clearly unarmed at the time of the volley of fire that ended his life. He had committed no crime. The Dohmen\'s then filed a $3M claim against the City of Long Beach and the 5 officers (Volker\'s fiancée sued separately for $25,000). The Long Beach City Council denied the claims (calling it "an unfortunate set of circumstances"), the parents\' declining health made them decide against the rigors of trial. The facts as described in reporting would not have seen this result in the 21st century – the LA area itself would have its first massive unrest caused by police violence in the Watts Riots the following year. In May 1966, the Dohmens, surviving son Lothar, and Volker\'s fiancée published a bittersweet memorial to Volker and the injustice of his killing in the Minneapolis Tribune. Volker had been a 2-time state chess champion, captain of the Macalester College soccer team, as well as the local Minneapolis Kickers, so his parents established 3 trophies for soccer and chess championships in his name. The family had a 4,000-word open letter published in an LA-area newspaper addressed to the people of Long Beach to restore their son\'s name. In 1970 the Dohmens, deeply bitter about being failed by the American justice system, returned to Germany.'),

Unadorned affordable housing tower. Lyndale Homes was a sub-section of the larger Glenwood Urban Redevelopment Project, originally comprising 28 short rows of townhomes (arranged around small courtyards) that surrounded this tower; the project had 198 units, with 88 of those in the tower itself—efficiency units for the elderly: doors were wide enough for wheelchairs, bathrooms had grab bars for the tubs, elevators were provided. Per the designers: "The program was conceived to provide a widely balanced community with wide range of family age and family size. Dwelling accommodations vary from five bedroom row house units to single bedroom row house units to the single bedroom and efficiency units in the high rise buildings." Builder: Johnson, Drake & Piper. The construction cost of just the high rise was estimated at $680,994. The 1960 jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C. Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "This would be an excellent solution on any terms but because of the difficulties and limitations invariably imposed on the architect in public housing projects it is exceptionally noteworthy. The site plan is good. Everything is in excellent proportion, including the high-rise building, which fits well and quietly in with its neighbors. There is a completeness to the project—it has a good beginning and a good end. The restraint and the use of the simplest possible forms is reminiscent of some of the world renowned Scandinavian projects. The unit plans, although necessarily standard, are well worked out." Interstate 94\'s planned alignment was "nailed down" to miss this complex (which was in the final stages of planning). This project was originally designated as "Minnesota 2-3" before being changed to Lyndale Homes in 1956. The Glenwood Urban Redevelopment Project included Lyndale Homes, Olson Homes, and Glenwood Homes but began construction at a slightly staggered schedule (in the order listed); the federal Public Housing Administration (PHA) provided more than $12,000,000 for the combined projects that in total housed 738 low-income Minneapolis families. As the projects were reading to break ground, there was a general belief that they may be the last large-scale public housing developments in Minneapolis, as (voiced in November 1957 coverage) "Opinion is growing that heavy concentration of low-income families in large projects creates social difficulties for tenants which would be lessened if housing were dispersed into \'normal\' neighborhoods in small buildings housing only a few families per building." Except for the 12-story tower that was part of Lyndale Homes, everything in the 3 projects was torn down by 2002 and replaced by a different approach to low-income housing; the surviving 12-story tower was renamed Art Love Manor.'),

Large physical education building for a public university campus. The designer, Richard F. Whiteman, remarked "I feel the design for this building is reduced to a very simple solution. The problem of providing separate circulation for spectators and participants was the primary concern of the design and this was solved by placing the lobby between the swimming pool and the gym, with spectators entering both spaces at the upper level and the participants having direct access to the swimming pool and gymnasium at the locker room level. A building of this type also has a very complex ventilation system which was simplified by locating the fan rooms above the lobby [the location of the mechanical penthouse]. The tremendous size of the gymnasium and swimming pool, we felt, should be another basic consideration which was solved by having the gym floor approximately ten feet below grade, and this helped simplify the massing of the building." Originally had a much thinner fascia at the roof line. The pool room originally had a series of thin vertical windows arrayed in a staggered pattern of 3 rows on an exterior wall (since eliminated in building expansions). Builder: Dean L. Witcher Co. (Minneapolis); Construction cost: $936,200. The 1960 jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C. Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "This is an excellent plan—straightforward and well organized. The relationship of the building to the site, as we see it in the photos, seems to be pleasant indeed, with the trees, the slopes and the buildings in complete harmony. The jury particularly enjoyed the detailing of the exterior stairs. We were not impressed with the entrance marquee and central column, which seem out of character with the refinement elsewhere so evident, but we consider this a lesser detail in an otherwise highly satisfactory whole. We felt that the architect had coped well with the mass of the building and we were impressed that he had not resorted to arbitrary embellishment but that the interesting features and details seemed to come naturally out of the basic design itself." The building has since had several major additions to its sides and is the core of what is now called the Physical Education Complex; the original entry canopy (not appreciated by the 1960 jury) has been replaced with a small, enclosed addition—however the external stairs, enjoyed the awards jury, appear to be mostly intact but with more complaint handrails (including adding central handrail).'),

L-shaped school complex comprising two main elements on Dutch Lake, the design places the main public use element to take in the lake view (the public element had glass on east and west sides to allow those approaching the building to see right through it towards the lake). In their submission to the AIA MN awards, the architects noted "There are two building units connected by a light linkage, one to house classrooms and spaces of nominally small dimension, the other to house the larger spaces for specialized construction in music and physical education, as well as a multi-use common space. The classroom building is a modular repetition of concrete bays, delineated in white. The other building is a composite of long-span steel framing and light steel framing, delineated in black. The enclosure of both is by gray-buff brick masonry and glass. Vertical slit openings in the classroom building are conceived primarily to present a vertical view-spectrum of sky, trees, and ground and to relieve the interior space to the outside with the most effective visual means. The crisp, strong rectilinear forms and surfaces of the buildings enhance and exploit the soft variety of form and surface of the natural environment." The classroom wing, designated as "A" unit, is three-stories and was designated as a "quiet" unit which also included the library, offices, home economics, industrial art shops, and the art department (no basement); the public wing, designated as "B" unit or the "noisy" unit is two-stories and was finished in the months after the school opened in Fall 1959. The gymnasium and cafeteria were designed with movable partitions for class and evening activities. The two structures were connected by 30-foot ramps. The 11-acre site included 1,500 feet of shoreline on Dutch Lake. The site originally included a knoll over which the access lane approached (from what was originally a country road, now Commerce Blvd); the knoll was cut to provide the parking area and the two elements of the building framed the parking area. To account for the remaining slopes, bridges connect the building elements to the original parking area. Designed for 850 students, it opened to 550; it was initially designed to be expanded to up to 1,000 by adding onto the classroom unit. Builder: C.H. Peterson Const.

The 1960 jury comprised noted Bay Area-based architects John Carl Warnecke, Donald Olsen (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), and Theodore C. Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "The west elevation is very inspired and dramatic, offering a good foil to the quietness of the rest of the buildings. The plan itself, especially the openness of the corridors, is excellent—visually well organized. The sloping site has been put to good use, adding to the overall attractiveness. The jury also commented upon the quality of the transitions and the detailing. There seems to be some confusion in the entrance facilities which may have been dictated by the program requirements of the site dimensions." Later renamed Grandview Middle School as the state discarded the "junior high" moniker. An addition to the public element made it a slight L-shape towards the west.'),

The design was for an entirely new church and Sunday school on a corner lot in a residential area; the site was perfectly flat but contained many old trees, so the original placement of the structure was to retain as many of those as possible (these have since died and been replaced with trees that are also now mature in 2023); the nave was designed to seat approximately 400 plus a choir housed in a balcony above the narthex. Sunday school and parish activities were placed in a split-level wing extending to the south. In describing the structure, the architects noted it "is almost entirely of brick with exposed brick walls in the lower part of the nave. The raised wall portion of the nave is accomplished with a continuous uninterrupted span of eighty feet providing a clear seating space without columns even under the lower exterior portions of the nave. This upper portion of nave wall is covered inside and out with wood paneling. The chancel wall is of brick in a rather intricate pattern with sidelights on both sides glazed with colored glass so the south light casts an interesting pattern of colored light on the brick."

Bernardi (also Prof. at UC Berkeley), which commented "The building has an external charm which we felt resulted partly form the delightful siting, partly from the use of materials. The jury felt that another point in the building\'s favor is that it would fit well into the neighborhood pattern. We liked the steeple but wished it had a little more vigor.

At the center of the living room is a large brick fireplace with copper hood and cushioned ledge; walls in walnut (used throughout the house, including ample built-ins); ceiling was cedar with fir beams; carpeted floors. The open, floating star used copper railings; the Albinsons had each stair "slip-covered" with carpeting that fastens with a zipper, so they could be cleaned easily and rotated to reduce wear. The master bedroom and bath open onto a long wooden deck which runs the length of the upper level and looks out over the view. The stair wall leading down to the amusement room was cinder block painted terra cotta to match the red tile entry hall; walls in the amusement room were also terra cotta, one of combed wood and the other of cinder block. The kitchen, with red tile floor and walnut woodwork, included big windows for views—some cabinets used sliding pegboard doors. Interior drapes were used to close off areas of the open space across the tree levels. Subject of a special feature in the Minneapolis Tribune on July 4, 1954 that opened with "Visitors to the Vogel Albinson\' beautifully-planned contemporary house exclaim at the fact that \'it looks so comfortable—and it\'s modern, too!\'" Albinson had a role in designing both his homes, though he would work with architect Gordon R. Oschwald on both. Included as part of the 6th Annual Radcliffe home tour in 1954, selecting houses for outstanding architecture and interior decoration (of both traditional and contemporary styles). Vogel "Vog" Albinson (d.1980, age 74) was a commercial artist, described in a 1941 article in The Minneapolis Star as "one of the town\'s leading commercial artists." In the mid-1940s he was associated with Albinson & Tollefson Advertising Art Agency; by 1947 the firm was called Photocopy Co., specializing in making "photostatic reproductions and photo murals." Later company names included Artists Inc., Blueprint Supply Co., and eventually consolidated into Albinson, Inc. which provided reprographic for the architectural, engineering and construction industries. Judith E. (nee Fredrickson; d.1999, age 89) was involved in country club activities. They had 3 children, Vogel Jr., Kent (d.1988, age 50), Lou Anne. Sold in c.1960 to attorney Samuel Saliterman as the Albinsons moved into a new house at 1900 Mount Curve Ave (also on the top of a hill) facing Minneapolis; the firm handling the design of the second Albinson house were Baker-Lange Associates (with Gordon Oschwald Design), founding partner Edward F. Baker had built his house next door to the Albinsons (2211 Hill Ln S) in 1956-57. In the 1950s, when there were only a handful of houses at the top of this hill, the street number assignment fluctuated as 2202 or even 2206 before settling on 2205.'),

Not long after the building was finished, it was picked up and moved from its original location at 31 10th Ave N (in the middle of the block) to this corner in order to make room for the expanding strip mall (allowing it to form an L-shape); the original location had the south side of the building lining up with the present southern façade of the stores at 907 & 913 Hopkins Center. Gordon Oschwald Design both did its own projects like this and worked for larger firms. The Finding Aid for the Gordon Oschwald papers at the Northwest Architectural Archives of the University of Minnesota names this building as some of his most characteristic work. Original clients were Dr. John E. Holcomb, DDS, and Dr. Philip W. Sheldon, DDS; Dr. Holcomb died young in 1971, age 54 (his widow lived to 2015, age 95); Dr. Sheldon practiced dentistry until 1978 and died in 1996, age 82. '),

The address is a little deceiving as, although it fronts Columbus Rd, it is accessible from a shared driveway with the 1921 Cape Cod-style house at 10401 Portland Ave S: these were part of the larger historic Parker Estate that sat at the elbow-intersection of Portland Ave S and 104th St E – this is the very bottom of the otherwise long street that goes right into downtown Minneapolis (Columbus Road to the south came later). The 10401 and 10405 were not separately sold until 2000 (divided into .46 and .45 acres, respectively). The Parkers traced their history to James Parker, a U.S. soldier in the War of 1812 who was an early settler in Minneapolis and eventually what is now Bloomington; this was the family estate. Dr. Clyde Parker (d.1986, age 81) was  active in First Augustana Lutheran Church (ads in the paper for the congregation would include lines such as "Annual Church picnic following morning service at Parker\'s 10405 Portland Ave. So.").

Penney department store (105,000sf). Featured in a May 1964 ad (in Progressive Architecture, then the biggest magazine on modernism) for formed fascia face panels made out of Plexiglas acrylic plastic (that facade is long gone). It was also included as one of several current projects in the January-February 1966 issue of Northwest Architect (by then the firm had become Thorsen & Thorshov). The site initially included a small, outdoor strip mall (which comprises the northwest corner, the upper half of the original short-side of the L-shaped footprint). To create a modern, air-conditioned indoor shopping mall the layout of that existing small strip mall was reversed, making the original back (south) ends face the air-conditioned hallways; the main strip of the new mall implemented natural clerestory lights and timber barrel vault roof. The inner walk featured trees, pools, planting, flags, lights, and shops facades to "create a festive shopping atmosphere" per Northwest Architect. Although the older structures only made up a small portion of the new mall, they are located the most prominent corner of the complex, to unify the exterior façade between sections, the exterior was clad with large, overhanging molded plastic fascias; major tenants were given separate large identifying masses of their own. Other major initial tenants included Field-Schlick, an S.S. Kresge variety store (same company that would develop K-Mart), Hove\'s Supermarket, a National Tea Co. market under their "Del-Farm" banner, Jackson-Graves, Stevenson\'s, and the Roseville State Bank. The center was surrounded with a parking lot with a 3,000-car capacity on the 50-acre site. Developed by Marie Slawik, widow of St. Paul car dealer Harold Slawik, under the Har-Mar Mall, Inc.; the name of combines the first 3 letters of Harold and Marie. Groundbreaking took place in May 1962. Roseville rearranged the frontage roads and traffic signals at Snelling Ave and County Road B to coincide with the opening. The grand opening was held on Wednesday, August 7, 1963 with a hot-air balloon as a center of attention and Minnesota Governor Karl Rolvaag in attendance along with Miss Minnesota (Sharon Carnes), St. Paul Mayor George Vavoulis, and the Queen of the Snows; a ceremonial ribbon was cut by Mary Ann Slawik, daughter of Harold & Marie. The design was created with plans for a movie theater. The intersection of Highway 36 and Snelling became a center of retail, with the Har-Mar Mall (1962), the first stand-alone Target store (1962, also owned by Dayton\'s; replaced with a Super Target), and Rosedale Shopping Mall (1969).'),

Safer House',E'Bliss, Robert L.',E'1960-61',E'The design is arranged around a central core of concrete walls that contain kitchen and bath; the exterior walls of the one-floor house are mostly glass with additional concrete. The design has a peculiar history: the owner, an associate professor of art at the University of Minnesota, had a previous house on the site to which he added small modern wing in the 1950s. He decided to have the original house removed and build a new house to match the wing he designed, for which he reached out to Robert L. Bliss, associate professor of architecture. Safer noted "Bob Bliss has a nice sensitivity toward architectural style. We\'ve been friends since he joined the faculty and I soon began to admire the things he does. He had a tough job picking up what I\'d already done on the wing and making everything hang together." Safer\'s 1960 summer project was building this house, and being unable to find builders with schedule availability, recruited help building it from university colleagues, Profs. Douglas M. Dearden (Biology) and Jerome E. Gates (art), and instructor Harold R. Wallace (retailing). Dearden was a member of the carpenters union and Wallace applied to be in the masonry union. The construction schedule was fit around summer courses taught by Safer and Dearden. Safer estimated the cost of the house as between $12,000-$14,000. The owner/professor joked "In general college the theory is that the student should be well-rounded in both intellectual and professional skills. I guess this shows the same exists in the pursuits of its faculty as well.'),

Baker built his first house next door to Albinson on Hill Lane S in 1956-57. Albinson had a role in designing both his homes, for this one he claimed in the Minneapolis Tribune that "I did turn it over to an architect so all the stresses would be in the right place." Architect Gordon R. Oschwald did the drawings, as he had on the Albinsons\' first house, which are available at the Northwest Architectural Archives in the University of Minnesota; under Gordon Oschwald Design he sometimes took on projects like this for larger firms like this collaboration with Baker-Lange. The house was featured on the Seventh Annual Kitchen Tour in August 1967, sponsored by the Abbott Hospital Auxiliary highlighting "handsome, functional kitchens" –notes on the tour in The Minneapolis Star noted the house has a "contemporary, cliff-dwelling effect" while the Minneapolis Tribune\'s preview by Mary Hart proclaimed the Albinsons residence was worth the price of admission because it not only featured the kitchen but the entire house: "Even thought the house is built on a 50-foot lot and clings to the side of a hill overlooking Kenwood Pkwy., you have a feeling of spaciousness from the time you enter the front door until you reach the windowed well on the other end. The house is built on levels, and in the center is a Japanese garden complete with running water. In every corner of this house are marvelous ideas created by the Albinsons to make their two-bedroom abode as comfortable and convenient as possible. The kitchen is one of the most workable and delightful I\'ve seen. It is compact, but has everything anyone could want—even a charcoal grill." It further noted "tree-top kitchen [. . .] cabinets are wood and metal of autumn gold. All are a foot above the floor with recessed lighting under them, casting a glow on the floor" further noting the dishwasher had unique sliding storage shelves. Vogel "Vog" Albinson (d.1980, age 74) was a commercial artist, described in a 1941 article in The Minneapolis Star as "one of the town\'s leading commercial artists." In the mid-1940s he was associated with Albinson & Tollefson Advertising Art Agency; by 1947 the firm was called Photocopy Co., specializing in making "photostatic reproductions and photo murals." Later company names included Artists Inc., Blueprint Supply Co., and eventually consolidated into Albinson, Inc. which provided reprographic for the architectural, engineering and construction industries. Judith E. (nee Fredrickson; d.1999, age 89) was involved in country club activities. They had 3 children, Vogel Jr., Kent (d.1988, age 50), Lou Anne.

A month later the listings mentioned the home was larger than it looked and referred to it being "Architect designed and custom build" with "no lawn work." Erco Inc. was a Fridley-based homebuilder run by Oliver E.

Redwood-clad, 2-story international style house that was featured in the Minneapolis Tribune on 07/31/1966; the article noted the house\'s novel inclusion of a roof deck (redwood platform) and garden with trees. The front of the house has view windows save for clerestory windows on the upper floor. The house was placed at an angle on the lot, so that sliding panels of glass with constitute the back of the house would take in the view and not a neighboring house. Redwood siding (unstained and treated only with sealer) was selected because it was the only wood available in 20-foot continuous boards, offered low maintenance, and was a color the owners enjoyed. The exterior features vertical fins. The owner noted that, despite the modern design, the layout was "basically colonial" with a central hall with stairway and four bedrooms upstairs, further adding "that\'s why Bruce Abrahamson, the architect, put those wall extensions [fins] on the front of the house to give a sort of pillar effect." The easy-upkeep was continued with multicolor slate flooring on the main floor. The outdoor corner formed by garage and house created a patio for outdoor dining in warmer months. The glass wall in the living room is protected by a three-foot overhang for passive solar gain in winter and shade in summer. Soon after construction the Hedelsons planted the roof garden with a pair of arborvitae and a large Mexican cactus, as well as germaniums, moss roses, radishes, and strawberries. The interior is full of custom-designed African Anagre wood millwork, including stair railings and the master bedroom’s built-in headboard and cabinetry with concealed drawers and shelves. Raymond V. Hedelson, originally from Yankton, South Dakota, was an attorney in Minneapolis practicing international law; he married Dorothy Schiager; he tragically died of a heart attack in April 1968.

You can\'t handle more than about 30 to 35 patients in a single circle. That\'s why we have three circles at Ancker. The secret is concentrating actual patient care in the circle. Extra services like the kitchens, teaching space, elevators and the rest are outside this patient circle. So the nurse is not distracted by noise or walking distance normal in a hospital. The circle plan means either better care or fewer nurses--there’s no question about that. We will have all the beds at Ancker on six floors in the three towers, with two towers of 36 to a floor, and one with 28 to a floor." Ellerbe meanwhile employed the design for the full Rochester Methodist Hospital (1963-66) and added a similar circular addition (though smaller) to Lakeview Hospital in Stillwater as well as to St. Luke’s (1961) in St. Paul (renamed United Hospital). Established in 1872 as the City and County Hospital, it was renamed the Ancker Hospital in 1923; upon moving to this location in 1965 it became known as the St. Paul-Ramsey Hospital; major addition in 1977 to the north side, accompanied by the name change to St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center; renamed Regions Hospital in 1997; several later additions (e.g. 2002, 2009, 2019). There was some discussion of where to place the hospital: whether to build it over the planned freeway (I-94) and thus adjacent to Miller and St. Joseph\'s hospitals to create a larger medical center, or to spread them out to keep them even further apart to address the Cold War-era "danger of having all medical facilities destroyed in the event of an air attack on the city." however the planners "finally concluded a nuclear bomb dropped anywhere in Ramsey county probably would destroy the hospital."'),
