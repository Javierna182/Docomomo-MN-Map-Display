The designer comments noted: "A \'retirement\' house for a couple with six grown children. The site is a bluff overlooking a small lake to the south. The owners had a strong preference for non-rectangular shapes. Program called for all rooms to be on one level, access to terrace and garden areas from the main rooms, ease of maintenance and compact arrangement. A guest house for visiting children and grandchildren was planned for on the site." With the clients request for non-rectangular shapes, the Closes used a triangular design. The 1959 jury comprised Pietro Belluchi (Dean of MIT\'s architecture program), Ronald Gourley (Assoc. Prof, Harvard), and Lawrence B. Anderson (MIT). Builder: Gust A. Johnson; Cost: $84,670.00. The house ended up featured in all sorts of places: The AIA Journal used a photo of the structure as one of 3 samples of Winston & Elizabeth Close\'s recent work in a September 1969 feature celebrating that they were the first couple simultaneously honored with FAIA status. Featured in a recognition of local modern architecture by the Walker Art Center in the early 21st Century. The house with angular, sometimes called Wrightian characteristics, lacked usual flat roof; stone floors, many built- ins, triangular porch overlooking Lake Marion; lot includes guest house. The house was tragically neglected and in absolutely dire shape when it went into foreclosure and for sale as in February 2012. Wide attempts to find a sympathetic buyer failed and it was demolished in 2013. In a somewhat positive result, it was replaced by a new modern house by ALTUS that in turn became widely recognized in magazines and the Star Tribune (the new house is on the same modest scale as the old).'),

The process garnered two separate newspaper features: 09/30/51 (Minneapolis Tribune) about the initial construction, 05/22/60 (The Minneapolis Star ) about how architects create interesting houses with difficult lots (plus the addition the built); Franz said he "used everything in the book" to safeguard the house he built on a slope in Lowry Hill; to safeguard against seepage and slippage; Franz said he and his wife "had to excavate three times as much gravel and sand overlay as we expected to get down to solid earth" when they began putting in the foundation for their converted shed home; the could dug it themselves, as no company would send machines to do it it for fear of starting a landslide; they buttressed the rear retaining wall with 16" horizontal and 12" lateral reinforcements; Franz said "We laid four-inch drain tile around three sides and filled in with crushed rock and gravel. Mastic coating was applied to the exterior of the backwalls. Maybe we went overboard a little, but we haven\'t had to wipe up a drop of water." Digging for the water main was fiasco because the city map was wrong (the city compensated them for the extra work). The 1951 article had photos of the wild design, under construction, with the then-engaged couple  still working on the natural cedar siding house; they had a traditional German house-raising ceremony, a Richtfest. In 1959 they doubled the size of their house by adding a living-room, two bedrooms add a bath in a side addition. The street was obliterated by the construction of I-94 in the 1960s; when it existed, Forest Ave ran parallel and just to the north of Ridgewood Ave, which is now (2020) where I-94 emerges from the Lowry Tunnel. By 1964 the Gayls bought an island on Lake Minnetonka and Franz\'s first plan was to move this house by barge; however they were “outbid” and opted to build a new house, while a section of this house (roughly matching the size of the \'59 addition) was moved on  September 10, 1964 to a new foundation built at 1133 Kenwood Pkwy in a vaguely similar topography (on the side of a steep hill); by 2020 the home still shows modern, but may be fundamentally a different house, though influenced by Gayl.'),

The one-story building that develops into a two-story building facing the courtyard is a refreshing surprise, and the stair wells at the four re-entrant corners are very well-handled, having excellent daylight and a good flow of space between floors.

When it opened, 50% of the permanent seats were box seats, the majority within 192 ft of home plate. For ease of access the field is located 16 ft below the ground level, with 4 main entrances, ample circulation areas, including 2 broad ramps which interconnect all the levels, facilitate the movement of large crowds. All materials were chosen for durability and ease of maintenance and their ability to withstand sub-zero temperatures. The P/A article noted the lighting “The field is lighted by 600-1500 watt luminaires from 138-ft-high tubular steel towers. Lighting—both day and night lighting—has been particularly well manipulated to enliven this handsome structure. Artificial light—primarily spots rather than planes of light—lends transparency and lightness to the structural frame. Sunlight, on the other hand, emphasizes the solid planes of the building and the rich integral color of the masonry." The exterior also featured a colorful series of brick panels in red, orange, yellow, brown, turquoise, light and dark blue, with seats enabled in blocks of blue, blue-green, and green.

(Jerry) Allen\'s "Criteria…" was planning an office building the opposite side of the HRA building. After some negotiations, the HRA agreed to forebear on the tower and Control Data bought Jerry Allen\'s property and agreed to let him design a new underground building that also used solar collectors as an experimental design. The resulting building was initially shared by architect and Control Data; Allan boasted he took "the worst piece of ground we could find, and in the process of building a building, we gave the city a park." Starting with a hilly, freeway adjacent site: earth was moved to create a southern exposure, then 2 large steel culverts (with sections removed to make them "C"-shaped) were sunk with space in between them. That open space was enclosed with glass and turned into a large atrium-greenhouse; solar heating systems and skylights were installed. The resulting corrugated steel, concrete, and glass structure was reportedly so well-sound insulated that, despite being next to the freeway, it required white noise generators. Allan and his family lived in the building, he conceived of it as "a 24-hour living-working environment." The central atrium contained a garden with year-round greenery and fruits & vegetables grew. Consultant: Wilhelm J. Reindle; Builder: Kraus-Anderson Construction Co.; Steel culverts produced by Armco Inc.; Engineers: Pope Associates, Inc., Fischer Engineering Inc., and Jacus Associates Inc. After living in it for a year, in 1980 Allan noted that "My wife says she feels very secure living here. It is quiet, very quiet. You don\'t have storms and such rattling your building." It was featured in The New York Times on March 15, 1981. In the very early morning of September 22, 1985, the north wing of TerraTech collapsed, killing 49-year-old Control Data librarian Maxine Ann Murray. Murray was living in the first-floor apartment previously occupied by the Allan family when she was crushed; it took rescuers 8 hours to reach her. Murray\'s estate filed a wrongful-death action against Control Data and received $450,000 in a May 1986 settlement.

The exterior used unfinished cedar siding (and some varnished cedar siding on the interior); interior walls also used ash plywood and, in the kitchen, birch. Walijarvi stated it fit into no particular style: "It\'s just an American house, no particular style. It\'s not modern or contemporary--nothing hard and fast. Just call it a utilitarian." The original, one-acre lot was considered "impossible to build on" when Walijarvi bought it in the mid-1950s after returning from a teaching position at Washington University in St. Louis. He wrote to various real estate agents looking for a hillside lot facing east, then weeded it down to this lot. The lot was so steep that building materials were brought up the more gradual slope on the other side and then slid down to the house site. In a May 9, 1963 feature in The Minneapolis Star, Walijarvi said he believed "A house should never be finished -- there should always be something you want to do to it. You should grow with it." The house was subject of a December 3, 1967 feature in the Minneapolis Tribune, highlighting its spaciousness despite its compact size. The architect noted his limited budget: "When we built it 15 years ago, we didn\'t have much of any money. The materials and building costs were as inexpensive as possible. And actually, it\'s a small house, the floor area is just 1,700 square feet." The piece also highlighted the influence of Walijarvi\'s Finnish ancestry and time living in California, to which he noted: "I remember my father talking about his childhood home with its one big, open living area. We have the same idea here, with the living room and dining room and kitchen all flowing together. And I think the house rather reflects California trends: open interior with balconies and no long, dreary hall." In approximately 2003, the house, and a few next to it, were all demolished, and the lots re-divided so now 5905 Lee Valley Rd is much larger than it was when it was just the architect\'s house.

Part of a wave of post-war construction later deemed the Third Generation Veterans Hospitals (1946-58): designed by in-house architects & engineers of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs; the overall strategy was helped guided by Carl Erickson (Chicago), Addison Erdman (New York City), and Slocum Kingsbury (Washington, DC). Technically the structure was an addition built to the north (front) of the existing building and connected to the original building (which remained in use) by a four-story connecting corridor. In the 2016 National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Documentation Form for "United States Third Generation Veterans Hospitals. 1945-1958" the style of these structures was described as "A multistoried, skyscraper-like central hospital building anchored the postwar medical campus, and midcentury modernism defined its architectural character. The new hospitals were faced in brick, and for the standard plan models, a red brick was used for the main hospital and ancillary, support buildings of the medical center. Austerity accompanied the skyscraper form and the resulting utilitarian character of the medical campus reinforced the priorities of the third generation program on healthcare provision rather than the designed landscape per se as costs were balanced. Similar to earlier Veterans Administration hospitals and to the new hospitals built through the Corps of Engineers, these VA standard plan hospitals had the main building as the campus focal point and, therefore, view sheds and sightlines to the main entrance were important to the site layout and spatial experience of the campus. Even so, the entrances themselves were modest and this sense of scale in the pavilion, in the use of lighting, and in the signage is a distinguishing feature of the VA standard plan hospital along with the red brick exteriors and bands of fenestration." The first "all-welded" building in the entire national VA-system; the 8-story building (with a set-back penthouse of 3 additional floors), was originally designed to be riveted, but the design shifted to welding to avoid the "machine-gun-like \'rat-a-tat-tat\' of the rivet guns" that was feared "would cause great disturbance" in the main hospital among patients. The new approach was designed by Baltimore-based consulting engineer Van Resselear P. Saxe, who had a patented clip for welded construction that held parts of the structural framework in place until it could be welded. Exterior was masonry. Builder: J.D. Hedin Const. Co. (Washington, DC) with American Bridge Co. (subsidiary of U.S. Steel), the latter used its Minneapolis plant for fabricating steel (2,100 tons of structural steel). Construction delays were possibly caused by the ongoing Korean War. The building (under construction) was featured in an ad for the American Bridge Company, in the July 1951 issue of Architectural Record, for the company\'s ability to do both welded and riveted construction. Alas, by 1974 a Veterans Administration survey found that the Minneapolis VA Hospital had the most serious space deficiencies in the entire VA system.

The homes designed by Norsen "reflect the contemporary design, modern equipment, spacious open planning, and delightful coloring" with prices from $15,000 to $30,000. Originally 33 lots; As of a Minneapolis Tribune feature on the neighborhood on 04/30/1950, 14 of the first 15 homes were designed by Norsen, who studied mechanical engineering at the University of Minnesota. The only non-Norsen house among the first 15 was Close Assoc.\'s Dr. Ruth Boynton & Prudence Cutright House (180 Norman Ridge). In explaining his design philosophy, Norsen stated "One of my basic assumptions is that most men want to keep their wives happy and young. To do it, they need a house that any ordinary woman can take care of herself, and still have time to enjoy other things in life besides housework." His designs were one-level, featured big fireplaces out of aggregate slag blocks (most with raised, cantilevered hearths, grates made of firebrick rather than steel, some that open two-way, and some with brass hoods), big living rooms with open plans and few doors outside of the usual private areas, usually 3 bedroom, plywood paneling instead of plaster, no footings (wood deck built over structural slab of concrete), large double-pane windows with additional use of clerestory windows in living rooms, passive solar heating on the south, accordion doors (especially between children\'s rooms so they can open up for play), tar and gravel roofs (especially on flat roofs).

The small church with education-social facilities was designed for a deaf congregation in the metro. The program considered good lighting, both artificial and natural, as well as good sight lines, as the prime design factors. The resulting structure was able to sit 120 in fixed pews with overflow expansion space up to 50 more seats; educational facilities for up to 100 children were provided so the facility could serve as a "vital social center for the deaf people of the area." The wooded lot  had an elevation change with the land falling away about 5-feet to the west side; the design was aimed to be "of a quiet, almost residential, character to harmonize with the neighborhood." Rapson and associates Douglas Baird & Gary Cook noted a "Court plan with connecting bridge to street evolved to give the deaf people a semi-private area for comfort and relaxation." A lower-level walkout level provides the social and educational space. The structure used precast concrete floor panels, concrete block basement walls, stacked-bound brick cavity walls on the upper level, and wood roof construction. The architects noted: "Roof is divorced from wall structure providing continuous \'halo\' of light both for general light and for architectural character." Interior was brick with a sand finish, plaster ceilings, and vinyl plastic flooring. The Honor Award jury consisted of Pietro Belluchi (Dean of MIT\'s architecture program), Ronald Gourley (Assoc. Prof, Harvard), and Lawrence B. Anderson (MIT), which commented "From the street this church appears low and inviting. It is symmetrical, which a rich entrance and indication in the roof of a main room beyond. With this beginning it is a little surprising to have the axis interrupted and to have to go around a screen wall to find the church proper on a transverse axis. The Altar and its appurtenances have a wonderful purity and simplicity and the continuous strip lighting near the ceiling gives a glowing atmosphere. Unfortunately the photographs do not show the interior effect of the axial cupola with the cross which is so important a feature on the exterior. Also we do not see the big windows from the inside and there may be some question whether these windows are consistent in treatment with the entrance grilles. In spite of these reservations, the conception and execution of this project command the highest respect as a very superior professional achievement." Builder: Isador Goldetsky & Son.

Public bathhouse and pool for the first-ring suburb with an accordion-style glass skylight over the facilities with open gables to allow air circulation. The City of Edina was able to raise the money from its citizens to build this within a larger Rosland Park. Arthur Dickey was specifically credited with this structure. In commenting on the project, the designer noted "The site, orientation and location of the pool and bathhouse were determined before our association with the project. Facilities needed were basket storage, dressing rooms, showers and toilets for both men and women." While the pool and building were only expected to be used for the three summer months, the bathrooms were expected to bs used during ice skating season in the park. The design note added: "It was our intent from the outset to design a building with a carefree, playful atmosphere. The intended use of the building presented some problems inasmuch as it is subjected to a great deal of moisture from the public\'s using the space and from the owner\'s procedure of \'hosing down\' the area twice daily. The answer to this problem resulted in the design of the large skylight over two-thirds of the roof area. The skylight is made up of simple 2x6 trusses resting on wood beams and covered with corrugated yellow plastic sheets and serves a twofold purpose. It admits a gay, happy light (all that is needed during daylight hours) and with the gable ends open it allows an adequate movement of air to keep the interior surfaces dry in conjunction with the louvers in the south wall. In the \'off season\' plywood panels fasten into the open gables to prevent vandalism. The exterior is buff colored face brick. Interior walls are concrete lock painted a light brown. All exposed steel and wood is painted white. Accent colors are red and yellow on the doors and louvers."

Minneapolis Star columnist Cedric Adams noted in April 1953 that "The Navarre amphitheater, a replica of the ancient Green and Roman amphitheater, is now being constructed [. . .] A life-like chariot will be mounted in full color and neon lighting at the back of the screen tower, which, by the way, will be 71 feet tall, and the customer area will be in a bow effect to provide better vision for the cars in the rear. The new outdoor house will also show three-dimensional movies, first outdoor installation of its kind in the area. There\'ll be speakers for 330 persons and there also will be seating accommodations for patrons from the immediate vicinity or for those whose cars are crowded. Powder room, a playground, and a nursery are among the added attractions. Distinctive it is." Working drawings for the site are available in the Liebenberg and Kaplan papers at the UMN Northwest Architectural Archive as "Amphi Theatre, 1949-1950, 1952-1953." It opened June 11, 1953 with a parade sponsored by the Navarre Business Association with fireworks after the June 12 (Friday) show; the first film was RKO Pictures\' "Split Second" starring Stephen McNally, Alexis Smith, and Jan Sterling. Ads that first season boasted it was "Air Conditioned by Lake Minnetonka Breezes!" and "Mosquito Controlled" with two shows a night, Adults charged 60¢ (tax included) with children under-12 free. Ahead of the 1955 season, Cedric Adams again wrote about it noting "patrons will see their movies on one of the largest outdoor screens in the Upper Midwest. Actual picture size will be 53 feet high and 100 feet wide. It\'s an advanced type of Cinemascope. The magnitude is breath-taking, say the moguls." The foresight to build a stage resulted in the venue being occasionally rented in the day for other events such as religious sermons (aimed at vacationers at the lake), as well as an attempt at live stage entertainment on summer nights when the sun was up longer (preventing film screenings). It was listed for sale in fall 1975 for $250,000, enticing potential buyers with "So you\'ve always wanted to be in Show Biz. Here\'s Your Chance." The last show listing in newspapers was 1979.
